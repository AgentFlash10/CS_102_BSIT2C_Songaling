"1","Leveraging Compressed Frame Sizes For Ultra-Fast Video Classification","Yuxing Han, Yunan Ding, Chen Ye Gan, Jiangtao Wen","Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)","Classifying videos into distinct categories, such as Sport and Music Video, is crucial for multimedia understanding and retrieval, especially when an immense volume of video content is being constantly generated. Traditional methods require video decompression to extract pixel-level features like color, texture, and motion, thereby increasing computational and storage demands. Moreover, these methods often suffer from performance degradation in low-quality videos. We present a novel approach that examines only the post-compression bitstream of a video to perform classification, eliminating the need for bitstream decoding. To validate our approach, we built a comprehensive data set comprising over 29,000 YouTube video clips, totaling 6,000 hours and spanning 11 distinct categories. Our evaluations indicate precision, accuracy, and recall rates consistently above 80%, many exceeding 90%, and some reaching 99%. The algorithm operates approximately 15,000 times faster than real-time for 30fps videos, outperforming traditional Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm by seven orders of magnitude.","Wed, 13 Mar 2024 14:35:13 UTC (13,036 KB)"
"2","Deep Learning Approaches for Human Action Recognition in Video Data","Yufei Xie","Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)","Human action recognition in videos is a critical task with significant implications for numerous applications, including surveillance, sports analytics, and healthcare. The challenge lies in creating models that are both precise in their recognition capabilities and efficient enough for practical use. This study conducts an in-depth analysis of various deep learning models to address this challenge. Utilizing a subset of the UCF101 Videos dataset, we focus on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Two-Stream ConvNets. The research reveals that while CNNs effectively capture spatial features and RNNs encode temporal sequences, Two-Stream ConvNets exhibit superior performance by integrating spatial and temporal dimensions. These insights are distilled from the evaluation metrics of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results of this study underscore the potential of composite models in achieving robust human action recognition and suggest avenues for future research in optimizing these models for real-world deployment.","Mon, 11 Mar 2024 15:31:25 UTC (467 KB)"
"3","The SIDO Performance Model for League of Legends","Amy X. Zhang, Parth Naidu","Applications (stat.AP)","League of Legends (LoL) has been a dominant esport for a decade, yet the inherent complexity of the game has stymied the creation of analytical measures of player skill and performance. Current industry standards are limited to easy-to-procure individual player statistics that are incomplete and lacking context as they do not take into account teamplay or game state. We present a unified performance model for League of Legends which blends together measures of a player's contribution within the context of their team, insights from traditional sports metrics such as the Plus-Minus model, and the intricacies of LoL as a complex team invasion sport. Using hierarchical Bayesian models, we outline the use of gold and damage dealt as a measure of skill, detailing players' impact on their own-, their allies'- and their enemies' statistics throughout the course of the game. Our results showcase the model's increased efficacy in separating professional players when compared to a Plus-Minus model and to current esports industry standards, while metric quality is rigorously assessed for discrimination, independence, and stability. Readers might also find additional qualitative analytics which explore champion proficiency and the impact of collaborative team-play. Future work is proposed to refine and expand the SIDO performance model, offering a comprehensive framework for esports analytics in team performance management, scouting and research realms.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 19:46:33 UTC (434 KB)"
"4","Can Large Language Models do Analytical Reasoning?","Yebowen Hu, Kaiqiang Song, Sangwoo Cho, Xiaoyang Wang, Hassan Foroosh, Dong Yu, Fei Liu","Computation and Language (cs.CL)","This paper explores the cutting-edge Large Language Model with analytical reasoning on sports. Our analytical reasoning embodies the tasks of letting large language models count how many points each team scores in a quarter in the NBA and NFL games. Our major discoveries are in two folds. Firstly, we find among all the models we employed, GPT-4 stands out in effectiveness, followed by Claude-2.1, with GPT-3.5, Gemini-Pro, and Llama-2-70b lagging behind. Specifically, we compare three different prompting techniques and a divide-and-conquer approach, we find that the latter was the most effective. Our divide-and-conquer approach breaks down play-by-play data into smaller, more manageable segments, solves each piece individually, and then aggregates them together. Besides the divide-and-conquer approach, we also explore the Chain of Thought (CoT) strategy, which markedly improves outcomes for certain models, notably GPT-4 and Claude-2.1, with their accuracy rates increasing significantly. However, the CoT strategy has negligible or even detrimental effects on the performance of other models like GPT-3.5 and Gemini-Pro. Secondly, to our surprise, we observe that most models, including GPT-4, struggle to accurately count the total scores for NBA quarters despite showing strong performance in counting NFL quarter scores. This leads us to further investigate the factors that impact the complexity of analytical reasoning tasks with extensive experiments, through which we conclude that task complexity depends on the length of context, the information density, and the presence of related information. Our research provides valuable insights into the complexity of analytical reasoning tasks and potential directions for developing future large language models.","Wed, 6 Mar 2024 20:22:08 UTC (750 KB)"
"5","An analysis of the NCAA college football playoff team selections using an Elo ratings model","Benjamin Lucas","Other Statistics (stat.OT)","In December 2023 the Florida State Seminoles became the first Power 5 school to have an undefeated season and miss selection for the College Football Playoff. In order to assess this decision, we employed an Elo ratings model to rank the teams and found that the selection committee's decision was justified and that Florida State were not one of the four best teams in college football in that season (ranking only 11th!). We extended this analysis to all other years of the CFP and found that the top four teams by Elo ratings differ greatly from the four teams selected in almost every year of the CFP's existence. Furthermore, we found that there have been more egregious non-selections including when Alabama was ranked first by Elo ratings in 2022 and were not selected. The analysis suggests that the current criteria are too subjective and a ratings model should be implemented to provide transparency for the sport, its teams, and its fans.","Wed, 6 Mar 2024 17:12:55 UTC (34 KB)"
"6","Revisiting Stereotypes: Race and Running","Tade Souaiaia, Nabie Fofanah, Rawle DeLisle, Sheena Mason","Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph)","The athletic achievements of African athletes in global running championships have long been subject to scientific and sociological inquiry. During the 1990s, a popular narrative emerged, suggesting that West African lineage conferred inherent sprinting advantages, and that North, South and East African's are specialized for longer distances. Part and parcel to this narrative was the enthusiastic belief that it would very soon be substantiated by a genotyping revolution that would enable prognostication of individual athletic potential. We revisit this hypothesis in the post-genomic era. First, we compare the global running records used to generate the racialist hypotheses with performances over the last twenty years (2004- 2023). Focusing on the 100m reveals intriguing trends, including the ascendancy of Jamaica as a sprint powerhouse and the elevation of South African and East Asian sprinters to the global stage, a direct challenge to the racialist paradigm. In line with an in-depth analysis of the influences on elite runners, we build a regression model to predict 100m performance based on environmental and psychological factors. Next, we direct our attention to 1500m, where the last two British champions have been part of a European resurgence that has not been seen in decades. Examining three different time periods, we identify a thirty year national slowdown (1989-2018). Adapting our model to this time period reveals striking evidence that racial perception has greater impact on performance than racial physiology. Synthesizing these findings, we introduce a psychocultural hypothesis, positing that interactions between racial perceptions and social dynamics shape the global distribution of running performance. We contrast this hypothesis with the racialist paradigm and propose extending it beyond sport where it offers insight across many domains.","Sun, 3 Mar 2024 19:27:30 UTC (424 KB)"
"7","PureLottery: Fair and Bias-Resistant Leader Election with a Novel Single-Elimination Tournament Algorithm","Jonas Ballweg","Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)","Leader Election (LE) is crucial in distributed systems and blockchain technology, ensuring one participant acts as the leader. Traditional LE methods often depend on distributed random number generation (RNG), facing issues like vulnerability to manipulation, lack of fairness, and the need for complex procedures such as verifiable delay functions (VDFs) and publicly-verifiable secret sharing (PVSS). This Bachelor's thesis presents a novel approach to randomized LE, leveraging a game-theoretic assumption that participants, aiming to be chosen as leaders, will naturally avoid actions that diminish their chances. This perspective simplifies LE by eliminating the need for decentralized RNG. Introducing PureLottery, inspired by single-elimination sports tournaments, this method offers a fair, bias-resistant, and efficient LE solution for blockchain environments. It operates on the principle of two participants competing in each match, rendering collusion efforts useless. PureLottery stands out for its low computational and communication complexity, suitable for smart contract implementation. It provides strong game-theoretic incentives for honesty and is robust against adversaries, ensuring no increase in election chances through dishonesty. The protocol guarantees that each honest player has at least a 1/n chance of winning, irrespective of adversary manipulation among the other n-1 participants. PureLottery can also address related problems like participant ranking, electing multiple leaders, and leader aversion, showcasing its versatility across various applications, including lotteries and blockchain protocols. An open-source implementation is made available for public use.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 12:30:17 UTC (858 KB)"
"8","ViSTec: Video Modeling for Sports Technique Recognition and Tactical Analysis","Yuchen He, Zeqing Yuan, Yihong Wu, Liqi Cheng, Dazhen Deng, Yingcai Wu","Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)","The immense popularity of racket sports has fueled substantial demand in tactical analysis with broadcast videos. However, existing manual methods require laborious annotation, and recent attempts leveraging video perception models are limited to low-level annotations like ball trajectories, overlooking tactics that necessitate an understanding of stroke techniques. State-of-the-art action segmentation models also struggle with technique recognition due to frequent occlusions and motion-induced blurring in racket sports videos. To address these challenges, We propose ViSTec, a Video-based Sports Technique recognition model inspired by human cognition that synergizes sparse visual data with rich contextual insights. Our approach integrates a graph to explicitly model strategic knowledge in stroke sequences and enhance technique recognition with contextual inductive bias. A two-stage action perception model is jointly trained to align with the contextual knowledge in the graph. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing models by a significant margin. Case studies with experts from the Chinese national table tennis team validate our model's capacity to automate analysis for technical actions and tactical strategies.

Our Long Short Term Memory Network (LSTMs) based approach enables efficient predictions of win-lose outcomes by only using the health indicator of each player as a time series. As a proof of concept, we evaluate our model's performance within a classic, two-player arcade game, Super Street Fighter II Turbo. We also benchmark our method against state of the art methods for time series forecasting; i.e. Transformer models found in large language models (LLMs).

This holds particular significance in the context of evaluating and advancing Large Language Models (LLMs), given the existing gap in specialized benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we introduce SportQA, a novel benchmark specifically designed for evaluating LLMs in the context of sports understanding. SportQA encompasses over 70,000 multiple-choice questions across three distinct difficulty levels, each targeting different aspects of sports knowledge from basic historical facts to intricate, scenario-based reasoning tasks. We conducted a thorough evaluation of prevalent LLMs, mainly utilizing few-shot learning paradigms supplemented by chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. Our results reveal that while LLMs exhibit competent performance in basic sports knowledge, they struggle with more complex, scenario-based sports reasoning, lagging behind human expertise. The introduction of SportQA marks a significant step forward in NLP, offering a tool for assessing and enhancing sports understanding in LLMs.","Sat, 24 Feb 2024 17:12:10 UTC (9,069 KB)"

Arenas","Computation and Language (cs.CL)","Classifying text is a method for categorizing documents into pre-established groups. Text documents must be prepared and represented in a way that is appropriate for the algorithms used for data mining prior to classification. As a result, a number of term weighting strategies have been created in the literature to enhance text categorization algorithms' functionality. This study compares the effects of Binary and Term frequency weighting feature methodologies on the text's classification method when stop words are eliminated once and when they are not. In recognition of assessing the effects of prior weighting of features approaches on classification results in terms of accuracy, recall, precision, and F-measure values, we used an Arabic data set made up of 322 documents divided into six main topics (agriculture, economy, health, politics, science, and sport), each of which contains 50 documents, with the exception of the health category, which contains 61 documents. The results demonstrate that for all metrics, the term frequency feature weighting approach with stop word removal outperforms the binary approach, while for accuracy, recall, and F-Measure, the binary approach outperforms the TF approach without stop word removal. However, for precision, the two approaches produce results that are very similar. Additionally, it is clear from the data that, using the same phrase weighting approach, stop word removing increases classification accuracy.","Wed, 21 Feb 2024 11:31:04 UTC (493 KB)"
"13","BeTAIL: Behavior Transformer Adversarial Imitation Learning from Human Racing Gameplay","Catherine Weaver, Chen Tang, Ce Hao, Kenta Kawamoto, Masayoshi Tomizuka, Wei Zhan","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","Imitation learning learns a policy from demonstrations without requiring hand-designed reward functions. In many robotic tasks, such as autonomous racing, imitated policies must model complex environment dynamics and human decision-making. Sequence modeling is highly effective in capturing intricate patterns of motion sequences but struggles to adapt to new environments or distribution shifts that are common in real-world robotics tasks. In contrast, Adversarial Imitation Learning (AIL) can mitigate this effect, but struggles with sample inefficiency and handling complex motion patterns. Thus, we propose BeTAIL: Behavior Transformer Adversarial Imitation Learning, which combines a Behavior Transformer (BeT) policy from human demonstrations with online AIL. BeTAIL adds an AIL residual policy to the BeT policy to model the sequential decision-making process of human experts and correct for out-of-distribution states or shifts in environment dynamics. We test BeTAIL on three challenges with expert-level demonstrations of real human gameplay in Gran Turismo Sport. Our proposed residual BeTAIL reduces environment interactions and improves racing performance and stability, even when the BeT is pretrained on different tracks than downstream learning.

Ihlen","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","The advancement of deep learning in human activity recognition (HAR) using 3D skeleton data is critical for applications in healthcare, security, sports, and human-computer interaction. This paper tackles a well-known gap in the field, which is the lack of testing in the applicability and reliability of XAI evaluation metrics in the skeleton-based HAR domain. We have tested established XAI metrics namely faithfulness and stability on Class Activation Mapping (CAM) and Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to address this problem. The study also introduces a perturbation method that respects human biomechanical constraints to ensure realistic variations in human movement. Our findings indicate that \textit{faithfulness} may not be a reliable metric in certain contexts, such as with the EfficientGCN model. Conversely, stability emerges as a more dependable metric when there is slight input data perturbations. CAM and Grad-CAM are also found to produce almost identical explanations, leading to very similar XAI metric performance. This calls for the need for more diversified metrics and new XAI methods applied in skeleton-based HAR.","Tue, 20 Feb 2024 07:58:04 UTC (526 KB)"

Our research introduces a novel framework for quantifying age-specific treatment effects, enhancing the granularity of performance trajectory analysis. Firstly, we propose a methodology for estimating the age curve using game-level data, diverging from traditional season-level data approaches, and tackling its inherent complexities with a meta-learner framework that leverages advanced machine learning models. This approach uncovers intricate non-linear patterns missed by existing methods. Secondly, our framework enables the identification of causal effects, allowing for a detailed examination of age curves under various conditions. By defining the Age-Conditioned Treatment Effect (ACTE), we facilitate the exploration of causal relationships regarding treatment impacts at specific ages. Finally, applying this methodology to study the effects of rest days on performance metrics, particularly across different ages, offers valuable insights into load management strategies' effectiveness. Our findings underscore the importance of tailored rest periods, highlighting their positive impact on athlete performance and suggesting a reevaluation of current management practices for optimizing athlete performance.","Sat, 17 Feb 2024 20:16:41 UTC (16,110 KB)"

Since the dynamic consequences of the string release may disturb the archer's postural equilibrium, they should have integrated them in their motor program to optimize postural stability. This study aimed to characterize the postural strategy archers use to limit the potentially detrimental impact of the bow release on their postural stability and identify characteristics that may explain a better performance. Six elite and seven sub-elite archers performed a series of 18 shots at 70 meters, standing on two force plates. Postural stability indicators were computed during the aiming and the shooting phase using the trajectory of the center of pressure. Two postural strategies were defined, as whether they were triggered before (early) or after (late) the string release time. Both groups used anticipated postural adjustments, but elite archers triggered them before the string release more often and sooner. Scores differed between the two groups, but no differences were found between early and late shots. Trained archers seem to have finely integrated the dynamic consequences of their bow motion, triggering anticipated postural adjustments prior to the string release. However, it remains unclear whether this anticipation can positively influence the performance outcome.","Wed, 14 Feb 2024 09:22:45 UTC (717 KB)"

For the data-driven model, we first found a large amount of public data including public data on tennis matches in the past five years and personal information data of players. Then the data is preprocessed, and feature engineered, and a fusion model of SVM, Random Forrest algorithm and XGBoost was established. For the mechanism analysis model, important features were selected based on the suggestions of many tennis players and enthusiasts, the sliding window algorithm was used to calculate the weight, and different methods were used to visualize the momentum. For further analysis of the momentum fluctuation, it is based on the popular CUMSUM algorithm in the industry as well as the RUN Test, and the result shows the momentum is not random and the trend might be random.

At the same time, there is a growing number of scientific papers using not commercial, but custom do-it-yourself IMU-based systems in medical and sports applications. Even though these solutions can help to popularize the use of this technology, they have more limited features and the description on how to design and build them from scratch is yet too scarce in the literature. The aim of this work is two-fold: (1) Proving the feasibility of building an affordable custom solution aimed at simultaneous multiple body parts orientation tracking; while providing a detailed bottom-up description of the required hardware, tools, and mathematical operations to estimate and represent 3D movement in real-time. (2) Showing how the introduction of a custom 2.4 GHz communication protocol including a channel hopping strategy can address some of the current communication limitations of entry-level commercial solutions. The proposed system can be used for wireless real-time human body parts orientation tracking with up to 10 custom sensors, at least at 50 Hz.

Previous works perform modelling by only the use of visual information, ignoring audio information. We argue that although AQA is highly dependent on visual information, the audio is useful complementary information for improving the score regression accuracy, especially for sports with background music, such as figure skating and rhythmic gymnastics. To leverage multimodal information for AQA, i.e., RGB, optical flow and audio information, we propose a Progressive Adaptive Multimodal Fusion Network (PAMFN) that separately models modality-specific information and mixed-modality information. Our model consists of with three modality-specific branches that independently explore modality-specific information and a mixed-modality branch that progressively aggregates the modality-specific information from the modality-specific branches. To build the bridge between modality-specific branches and the mixed-modality branch, three novel modules are proposed. First, a Modality-specific Feature Decoder module is designed to selectively transfer modality-specific information to the mixed-modality branch. Second, when exploring the interaction between modality-specific information, we argue that using an invariant multimodal fusion policy may lead to suboptimal results, so as to take the potential diversity in different parts of an action into consideration. Therefore, an Adaptive Fusion Module is proposed to learn adaptive multimodal fusion policies in different parts of an action. This module consists of several FusionNets for exploring different multimodal fusion strategies and a PolicyNet for deciding which FusionNets are enabled. Third, a module called Cross-modal Feature Decoder is designed to transfer cross-modal features generated by Adaptive Fusion Module to the mixed-modality branch.","Wed, 31 Jan 2024 15:37:12 UTC (3,168 KB)[v2] Tue, 20 Feb 2024 06:05:37 UTC (3,168 KB)"

This survey brings together the recent advances in the field of HDTs to guide future developers by proposing a first cross-domain definition of HDTs based on their characteristics, as well as eleven key design considerations that emerge from the associated challenges.","Sat, 3 Feb 2024 01:33:05 UTC (963 KB)"
"27","PageRank and the Bradley-Terry model","David Antony Selby","Methodology (stat.ME)","PageRank and the Bradley-Terry model are competing approaches to ranking entities such as teams in sports tournaments or journals in citation networks. The Bradley-Terry model is a classical statistical method for ranking based on paired comparisons. The PageRank algorithm ranks nodes according to their importance in a network. Whereas Bradley-Terry scores are computed via maximum likelihood estimation, PageRanks are derived from the stationary distribution of a Markov chain. More recent work has shown maximum likelihood estimates for the Bradley-Terry model may be approximated from such a limiting distribution, an interesting connection that has been discovered and rediscovered over the decades. Here we show - through relatively simple mathematics - a connection between paired comparisons and PageRank that exploits the quasi-symmetry property of the Bradley-Terry model. This motivates a novel interpretation of Bradley-Terry scores as 'scaled' PageRanks, and vice versa, with direct implications for citation-based journal ranking metrics.","Mon, 12 Feb 2024 17:16:25 UTC (86 KB)"

Scoring by the middlemost to attenuate biased judging in boxing","Stuart Baumann, Carl Singleton","General Economics (econ.GN)","Boxing has a long-standing problem with biased judging, impacting both professional and Olympic bouts. ''Robberies'', where boxers are widely seen as being denied rightful victories, threaten to drive fans and athletes away from the sport. To tackle this problem, we propose a minimalist adjustment in how boxing is scored: the winner would be decided by the majority of round-by-round victories according to the judges, rather than relying on the judges' overall bout scores. This approach, rooted in social choice theory and utilising majority rule and middlemost aggregation functions, creates a coordination problem for partisan judges and attenuates their influence. Our model analysis and simulations demonstrate the potential to significantly decrease the likelihood of a partisan judge swaying the result of a bout.","Fri, 9 Feb 2024 18:13:47 UTC (131 KB)"

Algorithms for SE tournament manipulation have been an active topic of research in recent years. In this paper, we initiate the algorithmic study of a novel variant of SE tournament manipulation that aims to model the fact that certain matchups are highly desired in a sporting context, incentivizing an organizer to manipulate the bracket to make such matchups take place. We obtain both hardness and tractability results. We show that while the problem of computing a bracket enforcing a given set of matches in an SE tournament is NP-hard, there are natural restrictions that lead to polynomial-time solvability. In particular, we show polynomial-time solvability if there is a linear ordering on the ability of players with only a constant number of exceptions where a player with lower ability beats a player with higher ability.","Fri, 9 Feb 2024 16:52:39 UTC (84 KB)"
"31","A Framework for Assessing Proportionate Intervention with Face Recognition Systems in Real-Life Scenarios","Pablo Negri, Isabelle Hupont, Emilia Gomez","Computers and Society (cs.CY)","Face recognition (FR) has reached a high technical maturity. However, its use needs to be carefully assessed from an ethical perspective, especially in sensitive scenarios. This is precisely the focus of this paper: the use of FR for the identification of specific subjects in moderately to densely crowded spaces (e.g. public spaces, sports stadiums, train stations) and law enforcement scenarios. In particular, there is a need to consider the trade-off between the need to protect privacy and fundamental rights of citizens as well as their safety. Recent Artificial Intelligence (AI) policies, notably the European AI Act, propose that such FR interventions should be proportionate and deployed only when strictly necessary. Nevertheless, concrete guidelines on how to address the concept of proportional FR intervention are lacking to date. This paper proposes a framework to contribute to assessing whether an FR intervention is proportionate or not for a given context of use in the above mentioned scenarios. It also identifies the main quantitative and qualitative variables relevant to the FR intervention decision (e.g. number of people in the scene, level of harm that the person(s) in search could perpetrate, consequences to individual rights and freedoms) and propose a 2D graphical model making it possible to balance these variables in terms of ethical cost vs security gain. Finally, different FR scenarios inspired by real-world deployments validate the proposed model. The framework is conceived as a simple support tool for decision makers when confronted with the deployment of an FR system.","Thu, 8 Feb 2024 15:07:21 UTC (2,622 KB)"

Given the sport's fast-paced nature and the critical importance of precise object (e.g. ball, player) tracking for both analysis and broadcasting, super-resolution could offer significant improvements. We investigate how advanced image processing through super-resolution impacts the accuracy and reliability of object detection algorithms in processing football match footage. Our methodology involved applying state-of-the-art super-resolution techniques to a diverse set of football match videos from SoccerNet, followed by object detection using Faster R-CNN. The performance of these algorithms, both with and without super-resolution enhancement, was rigorously evaluated in terms of detection accuracy. The results indicate a marked improvement in object detection accuracy when super-resolution preprocessing is applied. The improvement of object detection through the integration of super-resolution techniques yields significant benefits, especially for low-resolution scenarios, with a notable 12\% increase in mean Average Precision (mAP) at an IoU (Intersection over Union) range of 0.50:0.95 for 320x240 size images when increasing the resolution fourfold using RLFN. As the dimensions increase, the magnitude of improvement becomes more subdued; however, a discernible improvement in the quality of detection is consistently evident. Additionally, we discuss the implications of these findings for real-time sports analytics, player tracking, and the overall viewing experience. The study contributes to the growing field of sports technology by demonstrating the practical benefits and limitations of integrating super-resolution techniques in football analytics and broadcasting.","Wed, 31 Jan 2024 20:37:35 UTC (15,332 KB)"

Gomez-Vilda","Neurons and Cognition (q-bio.NC)","Human movement studies and analyses have been fundamental in many scientific domains, ranging from neuroscience to education, pattern recognition to robotics, health care to sports, and beyond. Previous speech motor models were proposed to understand how speech movement is produced and how the resulting speech varies when some parameters are changed. However, the inverse approach, in which the muscular response parameters and the subject's age are derived from real continuous speech, is not possible with such models. Instead, in the handwriting field, the kinematic theory of rapid human movements and its associated Sigma-lognormal model have been applied successfully to obtain the muscular response parameters. This work presents a speech kinematics based model that can be used to study, analyze, and reconstruct complex speech kinematics in a simplified manner. A method based on the kinematic theory of rapid human movements and its associated Sigma lognormal model are applied to describe and to parameterize the asymptotic impulse response of the neuromuscular networks involved in speech as a response to a neuromotor command. The method used to carry out transformations from formants to a movement observation is also presented. Experiments carried out with the (English) VTR TIMIT database and the (German) Saarbrucken Voice Database, including people of different ages, with and without laryngeal pathologies, corroborate the link between the extracted parameters and aging, on the one hand, and the proportion between the first and second formants required in applying the kinematic theory of rapid human movements, on the other. The results should drive innovative developments in the modeling and understanding of speech kinematics.","Sat, 27 Jan 2024 18:00:20 UTC (2,295 KB)"

The Magnus effect induced by spin adds complexity to trajectory prediction during flight and bounce dynamics upon contact with the ground. In this study, we introduce an innovative approach that combines a multi-camera system with factor graphs for real-time and asynchronous 3D tennis ball localization. Additionally, we estimate hidden states like velocity and spin for trajectory prediction. Furthermore, to enhance spin inference early in the ball's flight, where limited observations are available, we integrate human pose data using a temporal convolutional network (TCN) to compute spin priors within the factor graph. This refinement provides more accurate spin priors at the beginning of the factor graph, leading to improved early-stage hidden state inference for prediction. Our result shows the trained TCN can predict the spin priors with RMSE of 5.27 Hz. Integrating TCN into the factor graph reduces the prediction error of landing positions by over 63.6% compared to a baseline method that utilized an adaptive extended Kalman filter.","Tue, 30 Jan 2024 17:13:29 UTC (4,669 KB)"

In our analysis, we demonstrated the existence of solutions to the adaptive dynamics for the team game and determined their regularity. Moreover, we identified all stationary solutions and proved that these are precisely the Nash equilibria of the team game. Numerical examples are provided to highlight the main characteristics of the dynamics. The linearity of the team game results in unstable dynamics; non-stationary solutions oscillate and perturbations of the stationary solutions do not shrink. Instead, a linear type of branching may occur. We finally discuss how to experimentally validate these results. Due to the abstract nature of the team game, our results could be applied to derive implications and predictions in several fields including biology, sports, and finance.","Tue, 30 Jan 2024 15:17:45 UTC (291 KB)"

The high-speed and close proximity situations that arise in multi-agent autonomous racing require designing algorithms that trade off aggressive overtaking maneuvers and minimize the risk of collision with the opponent. In this paper, we study a special case of multi-agent autonomous race, called the head-to-head autonomous race, that requires two racecars with similar performance envelopes. We present a mathematical formulation of an overtake and position defense in this head-to-head autonomous racing scenario, and we introduce the Automaton Referencing Guided Overtake System (ARGOS) framework that supervises the execution of an overtake or position defense maneuver depending on the current role of the racecar. The ARGOS framework works by decomposing complex overtake and position-defense maneuvers into sequential and temporal submaneuvers that are individually managed and supervised by a network of automatons. We verify the properties of the ARGOS framework using model-checking and demonstrate results from multiple simulations, which show that the framework meets the desired specifications. The ARGOS framework performs similar to what can be observed from real-world human-driven motor sport racing.","Sun, 28 Jan 2024 22:21:38 UTC (2,225 KB)"

Here we provide the first comprehensive analysis of individual and team performance in cricket, one of the most popular sports in the world. We investigate temporal patterns of individual success, finding that the best performance of a player can happen at any time in their career, surrounded by a burst of comparable top performances. We show that long-term performance can be predicted from early observations and that temporary exclusions of players from teams are often due to declining performances but are also associated with strong comebacks. We demonstrate that teams are more likely to endure hot streaks of winning performances compared to random expectations, but also sequences of consecutive losses. We investigate the crucial contributions of specialists such as openers, all-rounders and wicket-keepers and show that a balanced performance from multiple individuals is required to ensure team success. Finally, we quantify how transitioning to captaincy in the team improves the performance of batsmen, but not that of bowlers.

Traditional clinical methods for diagnosing concussions suffer limitations when applied to female athletes, often failing to capture subtle changes in brain structure and function. Advanced neuroinformatics techniques and machine learning models have become invaluable assets in this endeavor. While these technologies have been extensively employed in understanding concussion in male athletes, there remains a significant gap in our comprehension of their effectiveness for female athletes. With its remarkable data analysis capacity, machine learning offers a promising avenue to bridge this deficit. By harnessing the power of machine learning, researchers can link observed phenotypic neuroimaging data to sex-specific biological mechanisms, unraveling the mysteries of concussions in female athletes. Furthermore, embedding methods within machine learning enable examining brain architecture and its alterations beyond the conventional anatomical reference frame. In turn, allows researchers to gain deeper insights into the dynamics of concussions, treatment responses, and recovery processes. To guarantee that female athletes receive the optimal care they deserve, researchers must employ advanced neuroimaging techniques and sophisticated machine-learning models. These tools enable an in-depth investigation of the underlying mechanisms responsible for concussion symptoms stemming from neuronal dysfunction in female athletes. This paper endeavors to address the crucial issue of sex differences in multimodal neuroimaging experimental design and machine learning approaches within female athlete populations, ultimately ensuring that they receive the tailored care they require when facing the challenges of concussions.","Tue, 23 Jan 2024 19:02:13 UTC (308 KB)[v2] Sat, 9 Mar 2024 11:36:52 UTC (342 KB)"

Alternatively, humans easily amalgamate information from video and language to infer information beyond what is visually observable in the pixels. An example of this is watching a news story, where the context of the event can play as big of a role in understanding the story as the event itself. Towards a solution for designing this ability in algorithms, we present a large-scale analysis on an in-house dataset collected by the Reuters News Agency, called Reuters Video-Language News (ReutersViLNews) dataset which focuses on high-level video-language understanding with an emphasis on long-form news. The ReutersViLNews Dataset consists of long-form news videos collected and labeled by news industry professionals over several years and contains prominent news reporting from around the world. Each video involves a single story and contains action shots of the actual event, interviews with people associated with the event, footage from nearby areas, and more. ReutersViLNews dataset contains videos from seven subject categories: disaster, finance, entertainment, health, politics, sports, and miscellaneous with annotations from high-level to low-level, title caption, visual video description, high-level story description, keywords, and location. We first present an analysis of the dataset statistics of ReutersViLNews compared to previous datasets. Then we benchmark state-of-the-art approaches for four different video-language tasks.

Commonly recommended wallet authentication methods, such as mnemonics or hardware wallets, can be cumbersome. This difficulty in user onboarding has significantly hindered the adoption of blockchain-based applications. We develop zkLogin, a novel technique that leverages identity tokens issued by popular platforms (any OpenID Connect enabled platform e.g. Google, Facebook, etc.) to authenticate transactions. At the heart of zkLogin lies a signature scheme allowing the signer to \textit{sign using their existing OpenID accounts} and nothing else. This improves the user experience significantly as users do not need to remember a new secret and can reuse their existing accounts. zkLogin provides strong security and privacy guarantees. By design, zkLogin builds on top of the underlying platform's authentication mechanisms, and derives its security from there. Unlike prior related works however, zkLogin avoids the use of additional trusted parties (e.g., trusted hardware or oracles) for its security guarantees. zkLogin leverages zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) to ensure that the link between a user's off-chain and on-chain identities is hidden, even from the platform itself. We have implemented and deployed zkLogin on the Sui blockchain as an alternative to traditional digital signature-based addresses. Due to the ease of web3 on-boarding just with social login, without requiring mnemonics, many hundreds of thousands zkLogin accounts have already been generated in various industries such as gaming, DeFi, direct payments, NFT collections, ride sharing, sports racing and many more.","Mon, 22 Jan 2024 07:23:58 UTC (5,297 KB)"

In this work, we focus on characterizing and predicting long-term bandwagon user behaviors in the context of online fan loyalty. Using a dataset collected from NBA-related discussion forums on Reddit, we trace the long-term loyalty status of bandwagon fans to capture their latent behavioral characteristics and then propose a computational model to predict their next sport season loyalty status with their home teams. Our analyses reveal that bandwagoning for most fans is a temporary switch and most of them will be back in the long term. In addition, online fans with different loyalty levels to their home teams have demonstrated different behaviors in various aspects, such as activity level, language usage and reply network properties. We then propose a model based on such behavioral characteristics to predict their next-season loyalty status.

But, it is a challenging task due to the non-linear motion of players, the similarity in appearance of players from the same team, and frequent occlusions. Therefore, the ability to extract meaningful embeddings to represent players is crucial in developing an effective tracking and re-identification system. In this paper, a multi-purpose part-based person representation method, called PRTreID, is proposed that performs three tasks of role classification, team affiliation, and re-identification, simultaneously. In contrast to available literature, a single network is trained with multi-task supervision to solve all three tasks, jointly. The proposed joint method is computationally efficient due to the shared backbone. Also, the multi-task learning leads to richer and more discriminative representations, as demonstrated by both quantitative and qualitative results. To demonstrate the effectiveness of PRTreID, it is integrated with a state-of-the-art tracking method, using a part-based post-processing module to handle long-term tracking. The proposed tracking method outperforms all existing tracking methods on the challenging SoccerNet tracking dataset.","Thu, 18 Jan 2024 12:45:14 UTC (8,587 KB)"

To successfully perform this task, the robot needs to (i) detect the incoming projectile, (ii) predict the projectile's future motion, (iii) plan a minimum-time rapid trajectory that can evade obstacles and intercept the projectile, and (iv) execute the planned trajectory. These four steps must be performed under the manipulator's dynamic limits and extreme time constraints (<350ms in our setting) to successfully intercept the projectile. In addition, we want these trajectories to be smooth to reduce the robot's joint torques and the impulse on the platform on which it is mounted. To this end, we propose a kinodynamic motion planning framework that preprocesses smooth trajectories offline to allow real-time collision-free executions online. We present an end-to-end pipeline along with our planning framework, including perception, prediction, and execution modules. We evaluate our framework experimentally in simulation and show that it has a higher blocking success rate than the baselines.

With the emergence of spatio-temporal transformers, the weakness of the prior strategies, e.g., 3D convolutional networks and LSTM-based networks, for capturing long-range dependencies has been effectively compensated. While VSP has drawn benefits from spatio-temporal transformers, finding the most effective way for aggregating temporal features is still challenging. To address this concern, we propose a transformer-based video saliency prediction approach with high temporal dimension decoding network (THTD-Net). This strategy accounts for the lack of complex hierarchical interactions between features that are extracted from the transformer-based spatio-temporal encoder: in particular, it does not require multiple decoders and aims at gradually reducing temporal features' dimensions in the decoder. This decoder-based architecture yields comparable performance to multi-branch and over-complicated models on common benchmarks such as DHF1K, UCF-sports and Hollywood-2.","Mon, 15 Jan 2024 20:09:56 UTC (766 KB)"

Despite the importance of midsole design, the potential of using in-plane density gradation in midsole has been rarely explored in earlier studies. The present work investigates the effectiveness of in-plane density gradation in shoe midsoles using a new class of polyurea foams as the material candidate. Their excellent cushioning properties justify the use of polyurea foams. Different polyurea foam densities, ranging from 95 to 350 kg/m3 are examined and tested to construct density-dependent correlative mathematical relations required for the optimization process. An optimization framework is then created to allocate foam densities at certain plantar zones based on the required cushioning performance constrained by the local pressures. The interior-point algorithm was used to solve the constrained optimization problem. The optimization algorithm introduces a novel approach, utilizing the maximum specific energy absorption as the objective function. The optimization process identifies specific foam densities at various plantar regions for maximum biomechanical energy dissipation without incurring additional weight penalties. Our results suggest midsole design can benefit from horizontal (in-plane) density gradation, leading to potential weight reduction and localized cushioning improvements. With local plantar peak pressure data analysis, the optimization results indicate low-density polyurea foams (140 kg/m3) for central and lateral phalanges, whereas stiffer foams (185-230 kg/m3) are identified as suitable candidates for metatarsal and arch regions in an in-plane density graded midsole design.","Sat, 13 Jan 2024 00:36:35 UTC (780 KB)"

In particular, we lack a deep scientific understanding of success in sports like tennis and the factors that contribute to it. Here, we study the unfolding of tennis players' careers to understand the role of early career stages and the impact of specific tournaments on players' trajectories. We employ a comprehensive approach combining network science and analysis of ATP tournament data and introduce a novel method to quantify tournament prestige based on the eigenvector centrality of the co-attendance network of tournaments. Focusing on the interplay between participation in central tournaments and players' performance, we find that the level of the tournament where players achieve their first win is associated with becoming a top player.

Rahmani","Signal Processing (eess.SP)","Respiratory rate (RR) serves as an indicator of various medical conditions, such as cardiovascular diseases and sleep disorders. These RR estimation methods were mostly designed for finger-based PPG collected from subjects in stationary situations (e.g., in hospitals). In contrast to finger-based PPG signals, wrist-based PPG are more susceptible to noise, particularly in their low frequency range, which includes respiratory information. Therefore, the existing methods struggle to accurately extract RR when PPG data are collected from wrist area under free-living conditions. The increasing popularity of smartwatches, equipped with various sensors including PPG, has prompted the need for a robust RR estimation method. In this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network-based approach to extract RR from PPG, accelerometer, and gyroscope signals captured via smartwatches. Our method, including a dilated residual inception module and 1D convolutions, extract the temporal information from the signals, enabling RR estimation. Our method is trained and tested using data collected from 36 subjects under free-living conditions for one day using Samsung Gear Sport watches. For evaluation, we compare the proposed method with four state-of-the-art RR estimation methods. The RR estimates are compared with RR references obtained from a chest-band device. The results show that our method outperforms the existing methods with the Mean-Absolute-Error and Root-Mean-Square-Error of 1.85 and 2.34, while the best results obtained by the other methods are 2.41 and 3.29, respectively. Moreover, compared to the other methods, the absolute error distribution of our method was narrow (with the lowest median), indicating a higher level of agreement between the estimated and reference RR values.","Wed, 10 Jan 2024 15:15:46 UTC (15,002 KB)"

The optimization of the generalized Keller's model is achieved through rigorous application of optimal control theory, specifically the Pontryagin Maximum Principle. This theoretical framework allows us to derive optimal control strategies that enhance the runner's performance, taking into account the constraints imposed by the changing terrain, nutritional dynamics, and the evolving fatigue factor. To validate the practical applicability of the model, simulations are performed using real-world data obtained from various mountain races. The scenarios cover various trail conditions and elevation profiles. The performance of the model is systematically evaluated against these scenarios, demonstrating its ability to capture the complexities inherent in long-distance trail running and providing valuable insight into optimal race strategies. The error in the total race-time prediction is of the order of several percent, which may give the runner a reliable tool for choosing an optimal strategy before the actual race.","Fri, 5 Jan 2024 17:55:20 UTC (982 KB)"

While there are established methods for time-stretching sines and transients with high quality, the manipulation of noise or residual components has lacked robust solutions in prior research. The proposed method combines sound decomposition with previous techniques for audio spectral resynthesis. The time-stretched noise component is achieved by morphing its time-interpolated spectral magnitude with a white-noise excitation signal. This method stands out for its simplicity, efficiency, and audio quality. The results of a subjective experiment affirm the superiority of this approach over current state-of-the-art methods across all evaluated stretch factors.

Generally, students are called on by the teacher during class and in the cer-emony if their family name is early on the list. Therefore, students whose surname ini-tials are earlier in the Japanese alphabet acquire more experience. Surname advantages are considered to have a long-term positive effect on life in adulthood. This study ex-amines the surname effect. The data set is constructed by gathering lists of representative figures from various fields. Based on the list, we calculate the proportion of surname groups according to Japanese alphabetical column lists. The major findings are as follows: (1) people whose surnames are in the A-column (the first column among 10 Japanese name col-umns) are 20% more likely to appear among the ruling elite but are less likely to ap-pear in entertainment and sports lists. (2) This tendency is rarely observed in the Uni-versity of Tokyo entrance examination pass rate. Consequently, the A-column sur-names are advantageous in helping students succeed as part of the elite after graduating from universities but not when gaining entry into universities.

Finding answers to such questions is not straightforward in the literature because the terms judgment and decision making are often used interchangeably. This terminology conflation leads to a lack of clarity on whether people make suboptimal decisions because of inaccurate judgments of information conveyed in visualizations or because they use alternative yet currently unknown heuristics. To decouple judgment from decision making, we review relevant concepts from the literature and present two preregistered experiments (N=601) to investigate if the task (judgment vs. decision making), the scenario (sports vs. humanitarian), and the visualization (quantile dotplots, density plots, probability bars) affect accuracy. While experiment 1 was inconclusive, we found evidence for a difference in experiment 2. Contrary to our expectations and previous research, which found decisions less accurate than their direct-equivalent judgments, our results pointed in the opposite direction. Our findings further revealed that decisions were less vulnerable to status-quo bias, suggesting decision makers may disfavor responses associated with inaction. We also found that both scenario and visualization types can influence peoples judgments and decisions. Although effect sizes are not large and results should be interpreted carefully, we conclude that judgments cannot be safely used as proxy tasks for decision making, and discuss implications for visualization research and beyond.","Wed, 20 Dec 2023 10:56:32 UTC (2,979 KB)[v2] Thu, 21 Dec 2023 19:22:28 UTC (2,990 KB)"

Recognizing this inadequacy, we put forward an integrated MOT method that not only marries object detection and identity linkage within a singular, end-to-end trainable framework but also equips the model with the ability to maintain object identity links over long periods of time. Our proposed model, named STMMOT, is built around four key modules: 1) candidate proposal generation, which generates object proposals via a vision-transformer encoder-decoder architecture that detects the object from each frame in the video; 2) scale variant pyramid, a progressive pyramid structure to learn the self-scale and cross-scale similarities in multi-scale feature maps; 3) spatio-temporal memory encoder, extracting the essential information from the memory associated with each object under tracking; and 4) spatio-temporal memory decoder, simultaneously resolving the tasks of object detection and identity association for MOT. Our system leverages a robust spatio-temporal memory module that retains extensive historical observations and effectively encodes them using an attention-based aggregator. The uniqueness of STMMOT lies in representing objects as dynamic query embeddings that are updated continuously, which enables the prediction of object states with attention mechanisms and eradicates the need for post-processing.","Tue, 19 Dec 2023 08:15:22 UTC (1,733 KB)"

For reliable perception of dynamic targets, we introduce elastic visibility-aware planning to actively avoid occlusion and target loss. Additionally, we propose a flexible terminal adjustment method that adapts the changes in flight duration and the coupled terminal states, ensuring full-state synchronization with the time-varying perching surface at various angles. A relaxation strategy is developed by optimizing the tangential relative speed to address the dynamics and safety violations brought by hard boundary conditions.

Incorporating the proposed analysis tool into the state-of-the-art turn-based forecasting model on the benchmark dataset reveals that it is, in fact, insignificant to reason about past strokes, while conventional sequential models have greater impacts. Instead, players' styles influence the models for the future simulation of a rally. On top of that, we investigate and discuss the causal analysis of these findings and demonstrate the practicability with local analysis.","Mon, 18 Dec 2023 05:37:51 UTC (4,079 KB)"

The basic idea and implementation methodology behind the approach is simple and straight forward. Borda Count Method has been used in sports award evaluations and many other scenarios, and therefore is an important aspect of our society. An often ignored ground truth is that online cultural rating platforms such as this http URL and this http URL often adopt integer rating values for large scale public audience, and therefore leading to Poisson/Pareto behavior. In this paper, we rely on the theory developed by Wang from 2021 to 2023 to demonstrate that online cultural rating platform rating data often evolve into Poisson/Pareto behavior, and individualistic voting preferences are predictable without any data input, so Borda Count Method (or, Range Voting Method) has intrinsic fallacy and should not be used as a voting theory method.","Sat, 16 Dec 2023 10:08:03 UTC (568 KB)"

"76","Enhancing Trajectory Prediction through Self-Supervised Waypoint Noise Prediction","Pranav Singh Chib, Pravendra Singh","Robotics (cs.RO)","Trajectory prediction is an important task that involves modeling the indeterminate nature of traffic actors to forecast future trajectories given the observed trajectory sequences. However, current methods confine themselves to presumed data manifolds, assuming that trajectories strictly adhere to these manifolds, resulting in overly simplified predictions. To this end, we propose a novel approach called SSWNP (Self-Supervised Waypoint Noise Prediction). In our approach, we first create clean and noise-augmented views of past observed trajectories across the spatial domain of waypoints. We then compel the trajectory prediction model to maintain spatial consistency between predictions from these two views, in addition to the trajectory prediction task. Introducing the noise-augmented view mitigates the model's reliance on a narrow interpretation of the data manifold, enabling it to learn more plausible and diverse representations. We also predict the noise present in the two views of past observed trajectories as an auxiliary self-supervised task, enhancing the model's understanding of the underlying representation and future predictions. Empirical evidence demonstrates that the incorporation of SSWNP into the model learning process significantly improves performance, even in noisy environments, when compared to baseline methods. Our approach can complement existing trajectory prediction methods. To showcase the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted extensive experiments on three datasets: NBA Sports VU, ETH-UCY, and TrajNet++, with experimental results highlighting the substantial improvement achieved in trajectory prediction tasks.","Sun, 26 Nov 2023 19:03:41 UTC (3,888 KB)"

We focus on traditional paddles used in the Arctic, one from Greenland and one from the Aleutian Islands. A basic modern European paddle is included in the study for comparison. First the paddle stroke parameters specific to sea kayaking are identified because previous studies were devoted to a competition context. The hydrodynamic force generated by the blade motion is detailed: two terms are identified, one involving the inertia of the water surrounding the blade at the beginning of its motion, and the second term is the classical drag/lift force. Drag and lift force coefficients were measured in a wind tunnel. The data allow computation of the hydrodynamic force during a paddle stroke. The European paddle was shown to be more efficient than the traditional paddles because of its shorter length to width ratio which contributed to a larger inertia effect. However, the force obtained with the traditional paddles better follows the imposed motion by the kayaker so that they are more comfortable and less tiring in the context of long distance trips, as those practiced in sea kayaking.","Wed, 13 Dec 2023 10:25:17 UTC (1,315 KB)"

This paper introduces a paradigm shift by harnessing generative modeling and large language models (LLMs) to enhance vision-based HAR. We propose utilizing LLMs to generate descriptive textual representations of activities using pose keypoints as an intermediate representation. Incorporating pose keypoints adds contextual depth to the recognition process, allowing for sequences of vectors resembling text chunks, compatible with LLMs. This innovative fusion of computer vision and natural language processing holds significant potential for revolutionizing activity recognition. A proof of concept study on a Kinetics700 dataset subset validates the approach's efficacy, highlighting improved accuracy and interpretability. Future implications encompass enhanced accuracy, novel research avenues, model generalization, and ethical considerations for transparency. This framework has real-world applications, including personalized gym workout feedback and nuanced sports training insights. By connecting visual cues to interpretable textual descriptions, the proposed framework advances HAR accuracy and applicability, shaping the landscape of pervasive computing and activity recognition research. As this approach evolves, it promises a more insightful understanding of human activities across diverse contexts, marking a significant step towards a better world.","Tue, 12 Dec 2023 03:58:24 UTC (54 KB)"

Here we show that the Kerr spacetime is also an exact vacuum solution of Einstein--æther gravity in a phenomenologically viable corner of the parameter space; the corresponding æther flow is characterised by a vanishing expansion. Such solution displays all the characteristic features of the Kerr metric (inner and outer horizons, ergoregion, etc.) with the remarkable exception of the causality-violating region in proximity of the ring singularity. However, due to the associated æther flow, it is endowed with a special surface, inside the Killing horizon, which exhibits many features normally related to the universal horizon of the non-rotating solutions -- to which it tends in the limit of zero angular momentum. Hence, these Kerr black holes are very good mimickers of their general relativity counterparts while sporting important differences and specific structures. As such, they appear particularly well-suited candidates for future phenomenological studies.","Mon, 11 Dec 2023 23:26:18 UTC (1,010 KB)"

Here we generalize this approach to incorporate two additional features: an element of randomness or luck that leads to upset wins, and a ""depth of competition"" variable that measures the complexity of a game or hierarchy. Fitting the resulting model to a large collection of data sets we estimate depth and luck in a range of games, sports, and social situations. In general, we find that social competition tends to be ""deep,"" meaning it has a pronounced hierarchy with many distinct levels, but also that there is often a nonzero chance of an upset victory, meaning that dominance challenges can be won even by significant underdogs. Competition in sports and games, by contrast, tends to be shallow and in most cases there is little evidence of upset wins, beyond those already implied by the shallowness of the hierarchy.","Thu, 7 Dec 2023 21:42:44 UTC (2,125 KB)"

In this paper, we establish a video text reading benchmark, named DSText V2, which focuses on Dense and Small text reading challenges in the video with various scenarios. Compared with the previous datasets, the proposed dataset mainly include three new challenges: 1) Dense video texts, a new challenge for video text spotters to track and read. 2) High-proportioned small texts, coupled with the blurriness and distortion in the video, will bring further challenges. 3) Various new scenarios, e.g., Game, Sports, etc. The proposed DSText V2 includes 140 video clips from 7 open scenarios, supporting three tasks, i.e., video text detection (Task 1), video text tracking (Task 2), and end-to-end video text spotting (Task 3).

There is a recent surge to develop human-centric foundation models that can benefit a broad range of human-centric perception tasks. While many human-centric foundation models have achieved success, they did not explore 3D and vision-language tasks for human-centric and required task-specific finetuning. These limitations restrict their application to more downstream tasks and situations. To tackle these problems, we present Hulk, the first multimodal human-centric generalist model, capable of addressing 2D vision, 3D vision, skeleton-based, and vision-language tasks without task-specific finetuning. The key to achieving this is condensing various task-specific heads into two general heads, one for discrete representations, e.g., languages, and the other for continuous representations, e.g., location coordinates. The outputs of two heads can be further stacked into four distinct input and output modalities. This uniform representation enables Hulk to treat diverse human-centric tasks as modality translation, integrating knowledge across a wide range of tasks. Comprehensive evaluations of Hulk on 12 benchmarks covering 8 human-centric tasks demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, achieving state-of-the-art performance in 11 benchmarks.

This potential is realized by harnessing recent advancements in positioning communication facilities, the Internet of Things, and artificial intelligence for feature mining in public transportation. However, the inherent complexities of disorganized and unstructured public transportation data introduce substantial challenges to travel feature extraction. This study presents a bus travel feature extraction method rooted in Point of Interest (POI) data, employing enhanced P-KMENAS and P-LDA algorithms to overcome these limitations. While the KMEANS algorithm adeptly segments passenger travel paths into distinct clusters, its outcomes can be influenced by the initial K value. On the other hand, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) excels at feature identification and probabilistic interpretations yet encounters difficulties with feature intermingling and nuanced sub-feature interactions. Incorporating the POI dimension enhances our understanding of travel behavior, aligning it more closely with passenger attributes and facilitating easier data analysis. By incorporating POI data, our refined P-KMENAS and P-LDA algorithms grant a holistic insight into travel behaviors and attributes, effectively mitigating the limitations above. Consequently, this POI-centric algorithm effectively amalgamates diverse POI attributes, delineates varied travel contexts, and imparts probabilistic metrics to feature properties. Our method successfully mines the diverse aspects of bus travel, such as age, occupation, gender, sports, cost, safety, and personality traits. It effectively calculates relationships between individual travel behaviors and assigns explanatory and evaluative probabilities to POI labels, thereby enhancing bus travel optimization.","Mon, 4 Dec 2023 07:21:27 UTC (1,739 KB)"

Accurate human mobility prediction for public events is thus crucial for event planning as well as traffic or crowd management. While rich textual descriptions about public events are commonly available from online sources, it is challenging to encode such information in statistical or machine learning models. Existing methods are generally limited in incorporating textual information, handling data sparsity, or providing rationales for their predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce a framework for human mobility prediction under public events (LLM-MPE) based on Large Language Models (LLMs), leveraging their unprecedented ability to process textual data, learn from minimal examples, and generate human-readable explanations. Specifically, LLM-MPE first transforms raw, unstructured event descriptions from online sources into a standardized format, and then segments historical mobility data into regular and event-related components. A prompting strategy is designed to direct LLMs in making and rationalizing demand predictions considering historical mobility and event features. A case study is conducted for Barclays Center in New York City, based on publicly available event information and taxi trip data. Results show that LLM-MPE surpasses traditional models, particularly on event days, with textual data significantly enhancing its accuracy. Furthermore, LLM-MPE offers interpretable insights into its predictions. Despite the great potential of LLMs, we also identify key challenges including misinformation and high costs that remain barriers to their broader adoption in large-scale human mobility analysis.","Wed, 29 Nov 2023 04:25:15 UTC (3,663 KB)"

We present two models for image generation using model-agnostic learning that align semantic priors with generative capabilities. RLDF, or Reinforcement Learning from Diffusion Feedback, is a singular approach for visual imitation through prior-preserving reward function guidance. This employs Q-learning (with standard Q*) for generation and follows a semantic-rewarded trajectory for image search through finite encoding-tailored actions. The second proposed method, noisy diffusion gradient, is optimization driven. At the root of both methods is a special CFG encoding that we propose for continual semantic guidance. Using only a single input image and no text input, RLDF generates high-quality images over varied domains including retail, sports and agriculture showcasing class-consistency and strong visual diversity.

Inspired by this event, we propose a novel human-based meta-heuristic algorithm called dragon boat optimization (DBO) in this paper. (Method) It models the unique behaviors of each crew member on the dragon boat during the race by introducing social psychology mechanisms (social loafing, social incentive). Throughout this process, the focus is on the interaction and collaboration among the crew members, as well as their decision-making in different situations. During each iteration, DBO implements different state updating strategies. By modelling the crew's behavior and adjusting the state updating strategies, DBO is able to maintain high-performance efficiency. (Results) We have tested the DBO algorithm with 29 mathematical optimization problems and 2 structural design problems. (Conclusion) The experimental results demonstrate that DBO is competitive with state-of-the-art meta-heuristic algorithms as well as conventional methods.","Mon, 27 Nov 2023 05:04:38 UTC (2,039 KB)"

To investigate this, we present a multimodal dataset with benchmarks collected using a novel pair of Intelligent Knee Sleeves (Texavie MarsWear Knee Sleeves) for human pose estimation. Our system utilizes synchronized datasets that comprise time-series data from the Knee Sleeves and the corresponding ground truth labels from the visualized motion capture camera system. We employ these to generate 3D human models solely based on the wearable data of individuals performing different activities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this camera-free system and machine learning algorithms in the assessment of various movements and exercises, including extension to unseen exercises and individuals.

Typically routes are assigned a grade to inform climbers of its difficulty and allow them to more easily track their progression. However, the variation in individual climbers technical and physical attributes and many nuances of an individual route make grading a difficult and often biased task. In this work, we apply classical and deep-learning modelling techniques to the 2016, 2017 and 2019 Moonboard datasets, achieving state of the art grade prediction performance with 0.87 MAE and 1.12 RMSE. We achieve this performance on a feature-set that does not require decomposing routes into individual moves, which is a method common in literature and introduces bias. We also demonstrate the generalization capability of this model between editions and introduce a novel vision-based method of grade prediction. While the generalization performance of these techniques is below human level performance currently, we propose these methods as a basis for future work. Such a tool could be implemented in pre-existing mobile applications and would allow climbers to better track their progress and assess new routes with reduced bias.","Tue, 21 Nov 2023 08:16:01 UTC (1,718 KB)"

This prophylactic knee orthosis is designed with a compression that is oriented in a chosen direction. The purpose of this compression is to improve stability in dynamic situations. Orthoses are used to provide functional improvements to knee problems. However, more scientific validation is needed for this type of product. Methods: 20 sportsmen in team sports performed a functional test: the Y-Balance Test. This reliable and reproducible test allows to evaluate the postural balance of the lower limb. The subjects were tested in 3 conditions: prophylactic orthosis with innovative compression, control orthosis (with no compression) and without orthosis. The average of the three trials were collected in each direction and condition. Results: The prophylactic orthosis had a better standardized score in the anterior direction (p<0.05) and a better composite score (p<0.05) than the control orthosis (no compression). However, there were no differences in the normalized score in the other directions. There were no significant differences between the prophylactic orthosis and without orthosis. Conclusion:Wearing the prophylactic orthosis improves postural balance compared to a orthosis with no compression. But there is no difference between the prophylactic orthosis and without orthosis on postural balance.","Mon, 13 Nov 2023 08:48:26 UTC (395 KB)"

The belief that success is primarily due to individual abilities and hard work rather than external factors is particularly strong in this context. In this study, we test this belief using tennis as a case study, due to its popularity and competition structure in direct-elimination tournaments. Our dataset covers the decade 2010-2019 of main events in the ATP circuit and consists of tourney results and annual rankings for professional male players. After a preliminary data analysis, we introduce an agent-based model able to accurately simulate the tennis players' dynamics along several seasons. We show that, once calibrated on the dataset, the model is able to reproduce the main stylized facts observed in real data, including the results of single tournaments and the development of players' careers in the ATP community. The strength of our approach lies in its simplicity: it requires only one free parameter a to determine the importance of talent in scoring every single point: a = 1, if only talent matters; a = 0, if the outcome of each point is entirely due to chance. We find the best agreement between real data and simulation results when talent weights substantially less than luck, i.e. when a is between 0.20 and 0.30. A further comparison between data and simulations, based on the analysis of the direct networks of all the matches, confirms the previous finding. A posteriori, we notice that this surprisingly important role of chance in tennis tournaments is not an exception. On the contrary, it can be explained by a more general paradoxical effect that characterizes highly competitive environments, particularly in individual sports. In other words, when the difference in talent between top players is minimal, chance becomes determinant.","Thu, 5 Oct 2023 11:47:39 UTC (11,284 KB)"

Existing research has shown that it is beneficial for recommendation performance to combine (user- and item-) ID embeddings with multimodal salient features, indicating the value of IDs. However, there is a lack of a thorough analysis of the ID embeddings in terms of feature semantics in the literature. In this paper, we revisit the value of ID embeddings for multimodal recommendation and conduct a thorough study regarding its semantics, which we recognize as subtle features of content and structures. Then, we propose a novel recommendation model by incorporating ID embeddings to enhance the semantic features of both content and structures. Specifically, we put forward a hierarchical attention mechanism to incorporate ID embeddings in modality fusing, coupled with contrastive learning, to enhance content representations. Meanwhile, we propose a lightweight graph convolutional network for each modality to amalgamate neighborhood and ID embeddings for improving structural representations. Finally, the content and structure representations are combined to form the ultimate item embedding for recommendation. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets (Baby, Sports, and Clothing) demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art multimodal recommendation methods and the effectiveness of fine-grained ID embeddings.","Fri, 10 Nov 2023 09:41:28 UTC (624 KB)"

Yet, accurate models of the system are necessary for model-based control, including models of vehicle dynamics and opponent behavior. Both dynamics model error and opponent behavior can be modeled with Gaussian Process (GP) regression. GP models can be updated iteratively from data collected using the controller, but the strength of the GP model depends on the diversity of the training data. We propose a novel active exploration mechanism for iterative GP regression that purposefully collects additional data at regions of higher uncertainty in the GP model. In the exploration, a MPC collects diverse data by balancing the racing objectives and the exploration criterion; then the GP is re-trained. The process is repeated iteratively; in later iterations, the exploration is deactivated, and only the racing objectives are optimized. Thus, the MPC can achieve better performance by leveraging the improved GP model. We validate our approach in the highly realistic racing simulation platform Gran Turismo Sport of Sony Interactive Entertainment Inc for a minimum lap time challenge, and in numerical simulation of head-to-head. Our active exploration mechanism yields a significant improvement in the GP prediction accuracy compared to previous approaches and, thus, an improved racing performance.","Fri, 3 Nov 2023 15:45:21 UTC (892 KB)"

However, its application to non-computer tasks has remained limited. This study aims to extend the application of Fitts' law to the realm of sports, specifically focusing on squash. Squash is a high-intensity sport that requires quick movements and precise shots. Our research investigates the effectiveness of utilizing Fitts' law to evaluate the task difficulty and effort level associated with executing and responding to various squash shots. By understanding the effort/information rate required for each shot, we can determine which shots are more effective in making the opponent work harder. Additionally, this knowledge can be valuable for coaches in designing training programs. However, since Fitts' law was primarily developed for human-computer interaction, we adapted it to fit the squash scenario. This paper provides an overview of Fitts' law and its relevance to sports, elucidates the motivation driving this investigation, outlines the methodology employed to explore this novel avenue, and presents the obtained results, concluding with key insights. We conducted experiments with different shots and players, collecting data on shot speed, player movement time, and distance traveled. Using this data, we formulated a modified version of Fitts' law specifically for squash.

"121","Muscle volume quantification: guiding transformers with anatomical priors","Louise Piecuch, Vanessa Gonzales Duque, Aurélie Sarcher, Enzo Hollville, Antoine Nordez, Giuseppe Rabita, Gaël Guilhem, Diana Mateus","Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)","Muscle volume is a useful quantitative biomarker in sports, but also for the follow-up of degenerative musculo-skelletal diseases. In addition to volume, other shape biomarkers can be extracted by segmenting the muscles of interest from medical images. Manual segmentation is still today the gold standard for such measurements despite being very time-consuming. We propose a method for automatic segmentation of 18 muscles of the lower limb on 3D Magnetic Resonance Images to assist such morphometric analysis. By their nature, the tissue of different muscles is undistinguishable when observed in MR Images. Thus, muscle segmentation algorithms cannot rely on appearance but only on contour cues. However, such contours are hard to detect and their thickness varies across subjects. To cope with the above challenges, we propose a segmentation approach based on a hybrid architecture, combining convolutional and visual transformer blocks. We investigate for the first time the behaviour of such hybrid architectures in the context of muscle segmentation for shape analysis. Considering the consistent anatomical muscle configuration, we rely on transformer blocks to capture the longrange relations between the muscles. To further exploit the anatomical priors, a second contribution of this work consists in adding a regularisation loss based on an adjacency matrix of plausible muscle neighbourhoods estimated from the training data. Our experimental results on a unique database of elite athletes show it is possible to train complex hybrid models from a relatively small database of large volumes, while the anatomical prior regularisation favours better predictions.","Tue, 31 Oct 2023 10:56:10 UTC (5,936 KB)"

This paper provides a reasonable approach to allocate the slots based on historical matches between these sets of teams. We focus on the FIFA World Cup due to the existence of an official rating system and its recent expansion to 48 teams. Our proposal extends the methodology of the FIFA World Ranking to compare the strengths of five confederations. Various allocations are presented depending on the length of the sample, the set of teams considered, as well as the frequency of rating updates. The results show that more European and South American teams should play in the FIFA World Cup. The ranking of continents by the number of deserved slots is different from the ranking implied by FIFA policy. We recommend allocating at least some slots transparently, based on historical performances, similar to the access list of the UEFA Champions League.","Sun, 29 Oct 2023 18:26:03 UTC (26 KB)[v2] Thu, 25 Jan 2024 11:43:05 UTC (28 KB)"

Existing approaches to interpreting the actions taking place within a video clip are based upon Temporal Action Localisation (TAL), which typically identifies short-term actions. The emerging field of Complex Activity Detection (CompAD) extends this analysis to long-term activities, with a deeper understanding obtained by modelling the internal structure of a complex activity taking place within the video. We address the CompAD problem using a hybrid graph neural network which combines attention applied to a graph encoding the local (short-term) dynamic scene with a temporal graph modelling the overall long-duration activity. Our approach is as follows: i) Firstly, we propose a novel feature extraction technique which, for each video snippet, generates spatiotemporal `tubes' for the active elements (`agents') in the (local) scene by detecting individual objects, tracking them and then extracting 3D features from all the agent tubes as well as the overall scene. ii) Next, we construct a local scene graph where each node (representing either an agent tube or the scene) is connected to all other nodes. Attention is then applied to this graph to obtain an overall representation of the local dynamic scene. iii) Finally, all local scene graph representations are interconnected via a temporal graph, to estimate the complex activity class together with its start and end time. The proposed framework outperforms all previous state-of-the-art methods on all three datasets including ActivityNet-1.3, Thumos-14, and ROAD.","Thu, 26 Oct 2023 15:49:35 UTC (17,630 KB)[v2] Mon, 30 Oct 2023 15:47:44 UTC (9,770 KB)"

In many sports, such as figure skating, automated evaluating methods based on pose estimation have been proposed. However, previous studies have evaluated skaters' skills in 2D analysis. In this paper, we propose an automatic edge error judgment system with a monocular smartphone camera and inertial sensors, which enable us to analyze 3D motions. Edge error is one of the most significant scoring items and is challenging to automatically judge due to its 3D motion. The results show that the model using 3D joint position coordinates estimated from the monocular camera as the input feature had the highest accuracy at 83% for unknown skaters' data. We also analyzed the detailed motion analysis for edge error judgment. These results indicate that the monocular camera can be used to judge edge errors automatically.

Fisher, Colin Montague","Applications (stat.AP)","Many enthusiasts and experts publish forecasts of the order players are drafted into professional sports leagues, known as mock drafts. Using a novel dataset of mock drafts for the National Basketball Association (NBA), we analyze authors' mock draft accuracy over time and ask how we can reasonably use information from multiple authors. To measure how accurate mock drafts are, we assume that both mock drafts and the actual draft are ranked lists, and we propose that rank-biased distance (RBD) of Webber et al. (2010) is the appropriate error metric for mock draft accuracy. This is because RBD allows mock drafts to have a different length than the actual draft, accounts for players not appearing in both lists, and weights errors early in the draft more than errors later on. We validate that mock drafts, as expected, improve in accuracy over the course of a season, and that accuracy of the mock drafts produced right before their drafts is fairly stable across seasons. To be able to combine information from multiple mock drafts into a single consensus mock draft, we also propose a ranked-list combination method based on the ideas of ranked-choice voting. We show that our method provides improved forecasts over the standard Borda count combination method used for most similar analyses in sports, and that either combination method provides a more accurate forecast over time than any single author.","Wed, 25 Oct 2023 17:43:26 UTC (120 KB)"

For college students in particular, the ability to converse can be an outlet for the stress and anxiety experienced on a daily basis along with a foundation for all-important career skills. In light of this, we designed SpeakEasy: a chatbot with some degree of intelligence that provides feedback to the user on their ability to engage in free-form conversations with the chatbot. SpeakEasy attempts to help college students improve their communication skills by engaging in a seven-minute spoken conversation with the user, analyzing the user's responses with metrics designed based on previous psychology and linguistics research, and providing feedback to the user on how they can improve their conversational ability. To simulate natural conversation, SpeakEasy converses with the user on a wide assortment of topics that two people meeting for the first time might discuss: travel, sports, and entertainment. Unlike most other chatbots with the goal of improving conversation skills, SpeakEasy actually records the user speaking, transcribes the audio into tokens, and uses macros-e.g., sequences that calculate the pace of speech, determine if the user has an over-reliance on certain words, and identifies awkward transitions-to evaluate the quality of the conversation. Based on the evaluation, SpeakEasy provides elaborate feedback on how the user can improve their conversations. In turn, SpeakEasy updates its algorithms based on a series of questions that the user responds to regarding SpeakEasy's performance.","Sat, 23 Sep 2023 17:19:32 UTC (1,433 KB)"

Originally, it was proposed for the ranking system of chess players, but it was soon adapted to many other zero-sum sports fields like football, baseball, basketball , etc. Nowadays, besides the traditional sports games, computer/video games are also playing an important role in social lives especially among the teenagers. In most of the online competition games, player's performance is usually scored and recorded by the game's ranking system. Meanwhile, ranking system like ladder in Dota is not the only the metric for the players to evaluate their gaming strength, an ELO rating score based on players in-game performance is also a decisive factor for gamers' matching. Namely, the matching system will refer to players' score in the ranking system and performance score system to ensure the matched players will promisingly undergo a balanced game without one team dramatically overwhelming the other. ELO scheme and its variants in modern online competition games aims to ensuring the expected winning rate for each team approaches 50\%. However, ELO rating is also causing compliments among players. In this research, I will dig into the advantages and drawbacks of leveraging ELO ranking system in online games and why it is still employed by game developers despite the fact that it is disliked by most of the players. Also, a new effort based rating scheme will be proposed and compared with ELO scheme under the simulation environment.","Wed, 18 Oct 2023 03:38:41 UTC (1,858 KB)"

The advent of deep learning has significantly improved the accuracy of pose capture, making pose-based applications increasingly practical. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of pose-based applications utilizing deep learning, encompassing pose estimation, pose tracking, and action recognition.Pose estimation involves the determination of human joint positions from images or image sequences. Pose tracking is an emerging research direction aimed at generating consistent human pose trajectories over time. Action recognition, on the other hand, targets the identification of action types using pose estimation or tracking data. These three tasks are intricately interconnected, with the latter often reliant on the former. In this survey, we comprehensively review related works, spanning from single-person pose estimation to multi-person pose estimation, from 2D pose estimation to 3D pose estimation, from single image to video, from mining temporal context gradually to pose tracking, and lastly from tracking to pose-based action recognition. As a survey centered on the application of deep learning to pose analysis, we explicitly discuss both the strengths and limitations of existing techniques. Notably, we emphasize methodologies for integrating these three tasks into a unified framework within video sequences. Additionally, we explore the challenges involved and outline potential directions for future research.","Thu, 19 Oct 2023 17:59:04 UTC (22,422 KB)"

This is also the case for professional sports, where leagues, clubs and players are using social media to reach out to their fans. In this respect, a huge amount of time is spent curating multimedia content for various social media platforms and their target users. With the emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI), AI-based tools for automating content generation and enhancing user experiences on social media have become widely popular. However, to effectively utilize such tools, it is imperative to comprehend the demographics and preferences of users on different platforms, understand how content providers post information in these channels, and how different types of multimedia are consumed by audiences. This report presents an analysis of social media platforms, in terms of demographics, supported multimedia modalities, and distinct features and specifications for different modalities, followed by a comparative case study of select European soccer leagues and teams, in terms of their social media practices. Through this analysis, we demonstrate that social media, while being very important for and widely used by supporters from all ages, also requires a fine-tuned effort on the part of soccer professionals, in order to elevate fan experiences and foster engagement.","Wed, 18 Oct 2023 20:59:39 UTC (43 KB)"

However, most of the current studies on player re-identification in multi- or single-view sports videos focus on re-identification in the closed-world setting using labeled image dataset, and player re-identification in the open-world setting for automatic video analysis is not well developed. In this paper, we propose a runner re-identification system that directly processes single-view video to address the open-world setting. In the open-world setting, we cannot use labeled dataset and have to process video directly. The proposed system automatically processes raw video as input to identify runners, and it can identify runners even when they are framed out multiple times. For the automatic processing, we first detect the runners in the video using the pre-trained YOLOv8 and the fine-tuned EfficientNet. We then track the runners using ByteTrack and detect their shoes with the fine-tuned YOLOv8. Finally, we extract the image features of the runners using an unsupervised method using the gated recurrent unit autoencoder model. To improve the accuracy of runner re-identification, we use dynamic features of running sequence images. We evaluated the system on a running practice video dataset and showed that the proposed method identified runners with higher accuracy than one of the state-of-the-art models in unsupervised re-identification. We also showed that our unsupervised running dynamic feature extractor was effective for runner re-identification. Our runner re-identification system can be useful for the automatic analysis of running videos.","Wed, 18 Oct 2023 04:15:39 UTC (2,147 KB)"

Toward this end, methods for submodular maximization via sequential greedy planning can be used for scalable optimization of camera views across teams of robots but face challenges with efficient coordination in cluttered environments. Obstacles can produce occlusions and increase chances of inter-robot collision which can violate requirements for near-optimality guarantees. To coordinate teams of aerial robots in filming groups of people in dense environments, a more general view-planning approach is required. We explore how collision and occlusion impact performance in filming applications through the development of a multi-robot multi-actor view planner with an occlusion-aware objective for filming groups of people and compare with a greedy formation planner. To evaluate performance, we plan in five test environments with complex multiple-actor behaviors. Compared with a formation planner, our sequential planner generates 14% greater view reward over the actors for three scenarios and comparable performance to formation planning on two others. We also observe near identical performance of sequential planning both with and without inter-robot collision constraints. Overall, we demonstrate effective coordination of teams of aerial robots for filming groups that may split, merge, or spread apart and in environments cluttered with obstacles that may cause collisions or occlusions.","Mon, 16 Oct 2023 22:23:18 UTC (2,136 KB)"

Focusing on word embeddings, we present a supervised-learning method that, for a given domain (e.g., sports, professions), identifies a subset of model features that strongly improve prediction of human similarity judgments. We show this method keeps only 20-40% of the original embeddings, for 8 independent semantic domains, and that it retains different feature sets across domains. We then present two approaches for interpreting the semantics of the retained features. The first obtains the scores of the domain words (co-hyponyms) on the first principal component of the retained embeddings, and extracts terms whose co-occurrence with the co-hyponyms tracks these scores' profile. This analysis reveals that humans differentiate e.g. sports based on how gender-inclusive and international they are. The second approach uses the retained sets as variables in a probing task that predicts values along 65 semantically annotated dimensions for a dataset of 535 words. The features retained for professions are best at predicting cognitive, emotional and social dimensions, whereas features retained for fruits or vegetables best predict the gustation (taste) dimension.

These studies either provide general insights for an entire app store which consists of millions of apps, or provide specific insights for a small set of apps. However, a single app category can often contain tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of apps. For example, according to AppBrain, there are 46,625 apps in the ""Sports"" category of Google Play apps. Analyzing such a targeted category of apps can provide more specific insights than analyzing apps across categories while still benefiting many app developers interested in the category. This work aims to study a large number of apps from a single category (i.e., the sports category). We performed an empirical study on over two thousand sports apps in the Google Play Store. We study the characteristics of these apps (e.g., their targeted sports types and main functionalities) through manual analysis, the topics in the user review through topic modeling, as well as the aspects that contribute to the negative opinions of users through analysis of user ratings and sentiment. It is concluded that analyzing a targeted category of apps (e.g., sports apps) can provide more specific insights than analyzing apps across different categories while still being relevant for a large number (e.g., tens of thousands) of apps. Besides, as a rapid-growing and competitive market, sports apps provide rich opportunities for future research, for example, to study the integration of data science or machine learning techniques in software applications or to study the factors that influence the competitiveness of the apps.","Wed, 11 Oct 2023 22:28:53 UTC (14,127 KB)"

While a variety of personas can be elicited from recent large language models, the opaqueness and unpredictability of these models make it desirable to be able to specify personas in an explicit form. In previous work, personas have typically been represented as sets of one-off pieces of self-knowledge that are retrieved by the dialogue system for use in generation. However, in realistic human conversations, personas are often revealed through story-like narratives that involve rich habitual knowledge -- knowledge about kinds of events that an agent often participates in (e.g., work activities, hobbies, sporting activities, favorite entertainments, etc.), including typical goals, sub-events, preconditions, and postconditions of those events. We capture such habitual knowledge using an explicit schema representation, and propose an approach to dialogue generation that retrieves relevant schemas to condition a large language model to generate persona-based responses. Furthermore, we demonstrate a method for bootstrapping the creation of such schemas by first generating generic passages from a set of simple facts, and then inducing schemas from the generated passages.","Tue, 10 Oct 2023 01:44:47 UTC (5,749 KB)"

However, these models fall short in simultaneously determining the optimal latent space dimension and the number of clusters. Here we introduce the latent shrinkage position cluster model (LSPCM), which addresses this limitation. The LSPCM posits a Bayesian nonparametric shrinkage prior on the latent positions' variance parameters resulting in higher dimensions having increasingly smaller variances, aiding in the identification of dimensions with non-negligible variance. Further, the LSPCM assumes the latent positions follow a sparse finite Gaussian mixture model, allowing for automatic inference on the number of clusters related to non-empty mixture components. As a result, the LSPCM simultaneously infers the latent space dimensionality and the number of clusters, eliminating the need to fit and compare multiple models. The performance of the LSPCM is assessed via simulation studies and demonstrated through application to two real Twitter network datasets from sporting and political contexts. Open source software is available to promote widespread use of the LSPCM.","Thu, 5 Oct 2023 16:04:48 UTC (6,440 KB)"
"146","Selecting the best compositions of a wheelchair basketball team: a data-driven approach","Gabriel Calvo, Carmen Armero, Bernd Grimm, Christophe Ley","Applications (stat.AP)","Wheelchair basketball, regulated by the International Wheelchair Basketball Federation, is a sport designed for individuals with physical disabilities. This paper presents a data-driven tool that effectively determines optimal team line-ups based on past performance data and metrics for player effectiveness. Our proposed methodology involves combining a Bayesian longitudinal model with an integer linear problem to optimise the line-up of a wheelchair basketball team. To illustrate our approach, we use real data from a team competing in the Rollstuhlbasketball Bundesliga, namely the Doneck Dolphins Trier. We consider three distinct performance metrics for each player and incorporate uncertainty from the posterior predictive distribution of the longitudinal model into the optimisation process. The results demonstrate the tool's ability to select the most suitable team compositions and calculate posterior probabilities of compatibility or incompatibility among players on the court.","Thu, 5 Oct 2023 09:51:55 UTC (74 KB)"
"147","Toward One-Second Latency: Evolution of Live Media Streaming","Abdelhak Bentaleb, May Lim, Mehmet N. Akcay, Ali C. Begen, Sarra Hammoudi, Roger Zimmermann","Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI)","This survey presents the evolution of live media streaming and the technological developments behind today's IP-based low-latency live streaming systems. Live streaming primarily involves capturing, encoding, packaging and delivering real-time events such as live sports, live news, personal broadcasts and surveillance videos. Live streaming also involves concurrent streaming of linear TV programming off the satellite, cable, over-the-air or IPTV broadcast, where the programming is not necessarily a real-time event. The survey starts with a discussion on the latency and latency continuum in streaming applications. Then, it lays out the existing live streaming workflows and protocols, followed by an in-depth analysis of the latency sources in these workflows and protocols. The survey continues with the technology enablers, low-latency extensions for the popular HTTP adaptive streaming methods and enhancements for robust low-latency playback. An entire section is dedicated to the detailed summary and findings of Twitch's grand challenge on low-latency live streaming. The survey concludes with a discussion of ongoing research problems in this space.","Thu, 5 Oct 2023 02:18:55 UTC (3,135 KB)"
"148","TempoNet: Empowering long-term Knee Joint Angle Prediction with Dynamic Temporal Attention in Exoskeleton Control","Lyes Saad Saoud, Irfan Hussain","Robotics (cs.RO)","In the realm of exoskeleton control, achieving precise control poses challenges due to the mechanical delay of exoskeletons. To address this, incorporating future gait trajectories as feed-forward input has been proposed. However, existing deep learning models for gait prediction mainly focus on short-term predictions, leaving the long-term performance of these models relatively unexplored. In this study, we present TempoNet, a novel model specifically designed for precise knee joint angle prediction. By harnessing dynamic temporal attention within the Transformer-based architecture, TempoNet surpasses existing models in forecasting knee joint angles over extended time horizons. Notably, our model achieves a remarkable reduction of 10\% to 185\% in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for 100 ms ahead forecasting compared to other transformer-based models, demonstrating its effectiveness. Furthermore, TempoNet exhibits further reliability and superiority over the baseline Transformer model, outperforming it by 14\% in MAE for the 200 ms prediction horizon. These findings highlight the efficacy of TempoNet in accurately predicting knee joint angles and emphasize the importance of incorporating dynamic temporal attention. TempoNet's capability to enhance knee joint angle prediction accuracy opens up possibilities for precise control, improved rehabilitation outcomes, advanced sports performance analysis, and deeper insights into biomechanical research. Code implementation for the TempoNet model can be found in the GitHub repository: this https URL.","Tue, 3 Oct 2023 04:43:19 UTC (2,755 KB)"
"149","Improving Trajectory Prediction in Dynamic Multi-Agent Environment by Dropping Waypoints","Pranav Singh Chib, Pravendra Singh","Robotics (cs.RO)","The inherently diverse and uncertain nature of trajectories presents a formidable challenge in accurately modeling them. Motion prediction systems must effectively learn spatial and temporal information from the past to forecast the future trajectories of the agent. Many existing methods learn temporal motion via separate components within stacked models to capture temporal features. Furthermore, prediction methods often operate under the assumption that observed trajectory waypoint sequences are complete, disregarding scenarios where missing values may occur, which can influence their performance. Moreover, these models may be biased toward particular waypoint sequences when making predictions. We propose a novel approach called Temporal Waypoint Dropping (TWD) that explicitly incorporates temporal dependencies during the training of a trajectory prediction model. By stochastically dropping waypoints from past observed trajectories, the model is forced to learn the underlying temporal representation from the remaining waypoints, resulting in an improved model. Incorporating stochastic temporal waypoint dropping into the model learning process significantly enhances its performance in scenarios with missing values. Experimental results demonstrate our approach's substantial improvement in trajectory prediction capabilities. Our approach can complement existing trajectory prediction methods to improve their prediction accuracy. We evaluate our proposed approach on three datasets: NBA Sports VU, ETH-UCY, and TrajNet++.","Fri, 29 Sep 2023 15:48:35 UTC (5,184 KB)[v2] Sun, 26 Nov 2023 18:53:50 UTC (4,954 KB)"
"150","Method and Validation for Optimal Lineup Creation for Daily Fantasy Football Using Machine Learning and Linear Programming","Joseph M. Mahoney, Tomasz B. Paniak","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","Daily fantasy sports (DFS) are weekly or daily online contests where real-game performances of individual players are converted to fantasy points (FPTS). Users select players for their lineup to maximize their FPTS within a set player salary cap. This paper focuses on (1) the development of a method to forecast NFL player performance under uncertainty and (2) determining an optimal lineup to maximize FPTS under a set salary limit. A supervised learning neural network was created and used to project FPTS based on past player performance (2018 NFL regular season for this work) prior to the upcoming week. These projected FPTS were used in a mixed integer linear program to find the optimal lineup. The performance of resultant lineups was compared to randomly-created lineups. On average, the optimal lineups outperformed the random lineups. The generated lineups were then compared to real-world lineups from users on DraftKings. The generated lineups generally fell in approximately the 31st percentile (median). The FPTS methods and predictions presented here can be further improved using this study as a baseline comparison.","Tue, 26 Sep 2023 20:26:32 UTC (322 KB)[v2] Thu, 28 Sep 2023 12:15:16 UTC (322 KB)"
