"1","leveraging compressed frame sizes for ultra-fast video classification","yuxing han, yunan ding, chen ye gan, jiangtao wen","computer vision and pattern recognition","classifying videos into distinct categories, such as sport and music video, is crucial for multimedia understanding and retrieval, especially when an immense volume of video content is being constantly generated. traditional methods require video decompression to extract pixel-level features like color, texture, and motion, thereby increasing computational and storage demands. moreover, these methods often suffer from performance degradation in low-quality videos. we present a novel approach that examines only the post-compression bitstream of a video to perform classification, eliminating the need for bitstream decoding. to validate our approach, we built a comprehensive data set comprising over 29,000 youtube video clips, totaling 6,000 hours and spanning 11 distinct categories. our evaluations indicate precision, accuracy, and recall rates consistently above 80%, many exceeding 90%, and some reaching 99%. the algorithm operates approximately 15,000 times faster than real-time for 30fps videos, outperforming traditional dynamic time warping (dtw) algorithm by seven orders of magnitude.",2024-03-13
"2","deep learning approaches for human action recognition in video data","yufei xie","computer vision and pattern recognition","human action recognition in videos is a critical task with significant implications for numerous applications, including surveillance, sports analytics, and healthcare. the challenge lies in creating models that are both precise in their recognition capabilities and efficient enough for practical use. this study conducts an in-depth analysis of various deep learning models to address this challenge. utilizing a subset of the ucf101 videos dataset, we focus on convolutional neural networks (cnns), recurrent neural networks (rnns), and two-stream convnets. the research reveals that while cnns effectively capture spatial features and rnns encode temporal sequences, two-stream convnets exhibit superior performance by integrating spatial and temporal dimensions. these insights are distilled from the evaluation metrics of accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score. the results of this study underscore the potential of composite models in achieving robust human action recognition and suggest avenues for future research in optimizing these models for real-world deployment.",2024-03-11
"3","the sido performance model for league of legends","amy x. zhang, parth naidu","applications","league of legends (lol) has been a dominant esport for a decade, yet the inherent complexity of the game has stymied the creation of analytical measures of player skill and performance. current industry standards are limited to easy-to-procure individual player statistics that are incomplete and lacking context as they do not take into account teamplay or game state. we present a unified performance model for league of legends which blends together measures of a player's contribution within the context of their team, insights from traditional sports metrics such as the plus-minus model, and the intricacies of lol as a complex team invasion sport. using hierarchical bayesian models, we outline the use of gold and damage dealt as a measure of skill, detailing players' impact on their own-, their allies'- and their enemies' statistics throughout the course of the game. our results showcase the model's increased efficacy in separating professional players when compared to a plus-minus model and to current esports industry standards, while metric quality is rigorously assessed for discrimination, independence, and stability. readers might also find additional qualitative analytics which explore champion proficiency and the impact of collaborative team-play. future work is proposed to refine and expand the sido performance model, offering a comprehensive framework for esports analytics in team performance management, scouting and research realms.",2024-03-07
"4","can large language models do analytical reasoning?","yebowen hu, kaiqiang song, sangwoo cho, xiaoyang wang, hassan foroosh, dong yu, fei liu","computation and language","this paper explores the cutting-edge large language model with analytical reasoning on sports. our analytical reasoning embodies the tasks of letting large language models count how many points each team scores in a quarter in the nba and nfl games. our major discoveries are in two folds. firstly, we find among all the models we employed, gpt-4 stands out in effectiveness, followed by claude-2.1, with gpt-3.5, gemini-pro, and llama-2-70b lagging behind. specifically, we compare three different prompting techniques and a divide-and-conquer approach, we find that the latter was the most effective. our divide-and-conquer approach breaks down play-by-play data into smaller, more manageable segments, solves each piece individually, and then aggregates them together. besides the divide-and-conquer approach, we also explore the chain of thought (cot) strategy, which markedly improves outcomes for certain models, notably gpt-4 and claude-2.1, with their accuracy rates increasing significantly. however, the cot strategy has negligible or even detrimental effects on the performance of other models like gpt-3.5 and gemini-pro. secondly, to our surprise, we observe that most models, including gpt-4, struggle to accurately count the total scores for nba quarters despite showing strong performance in counting nfl quarter scores. this leads us to further investigate the factors that impact the complexity of analytical reasoning tasks with extensive experiments, through which we conclude that task complexity depends on the length of context, the information density, and the presence of related information. our research provides valuable insights into the complexity of analytical reasoning tasks and potential directions for developing future large language models.",2024-03-06
"5","an analysis of the ncaa college football playoff team selections using an elo ratings model","benjamin lucas","other statistics","in december 2023 the florida state seminoles became the first power 5 school to have an undefeated season and miss selection for the college football playoff. in order to assess this decision, we employed an elo ratings model to rank the teams and found that the selection committee's decision was justified and that florida state were not one of the four best teams in college football in that season (ranking only 11th!). we extended this analysis to all other years of the cfp and found that the top four teams by elo ratings differ greatly from the four teams selected in almost every year of the cfp's existence. furthermore, we found that there have been more egregious non-selections including when alabama was ranked first by elo ratings in 2022 and were not selected. the analysis suggests that the current criteria are too subjective and a ratings model should be implemented to provide transparency for the sport, its teams, and its fans.",2024-03-06
"6","revisiting stereotypes: race and running","tade souaiaia, nabie fofanah, rawle delisle, sheena mason","physics and society","the athletic achievements of african athletes in global running championships have long been subject to scientific and sociological inquiry. during the 1990s, a popular narrative emerged, suggesting that west african lineage conferred inherent sprinting advantages, and that north, south and east african's are specialized for longer distances. part and parcel to this narrative was the enthusiastic belief that it would very soon be substantiated by a genotyping revolution that would enable prognostication of individual athletic potential. we revisit this hypothesis in the post-genomic era. first, we compare the global running records used to generate the racialist hypotheses with performances over the last twenty years (2004- 2023). focusing on the 100m reveals intriguing trends, including the ascendancy of jamaica as a sprint powerhouse and the elevation of south african and east asian sprinters to the global stage, a direct challenge to the racialist paradigm. in line with an in-depth analysis of the influences on elite runners, we build a regression model to predict 100m performance based on environmental and psychological factors. next, we direct our attention to 1500m, where the last two british champions have been part of a european resurgence that has not been seen in decades. examining three different time periods, we identify a thirty year national slowdown (1989-2018). adapting our model to this time period reveals striking evidence that racial perception has greater impact on performance than racial physiology. synthesizing these findings, we introduce a psychocultural hypothesis, positing that interactions between racial perceptions and social dynamics shape the global distribution of running performance. we contrast this hypothesis with the racialist paradigm and propose extending it beyond sport where it offers insight across many domains.",2024-03-03
"7","purelottery: fair and bias-resistant leader election with a novel single-elimination tournament algorithm","jonas ballweg","data structures and algorithms","leader election (le) is crucial in distributed systems and blockchain technology, ensuring one participant acts as the leader. traditional le methods often depend on distributed random number generation (rng), facing issues like vulnerability to manipulation, lack of fairness, and the need for complex procedures such as verifiable delay functions (vdfs) and publicly-verifiable secret sharing (pvss). this bachelor's thesis presents a novel approach to randomized le, leveraging a game-theoretic assumption that participants, aiming to be chosen as leaders, will naturally avoid actions that diminish their chances. this perspective simplifies le by eliminating the need for decentralized rng. introducing purelottery, inspired by single-elimination sports tournaments, this method offers a fair, bias-resistant, and efficient le solution for blockchain environments. it operates on the principle of two participants competing in each match, rendering collusion efforts useless. purelottery stands out for its low computational and communication complexity, suitable for smart contract implementation. it provides strong game-theoretic incentives for honesty and is robust against adversaries, ensuring no increase in election chances through dishonesty. the protocol guarantees that each honest player has at least a 1/n chance of winning, irrespective of adversary manipulation among the other n-1 participants. purelottery can also address related problems like participant ranking, electing multiple leaders, and leader aversion, showcasing its versatility across various applications, including lotteries and blockchain protocols. an open-source implementation is made available for public use.",2024-02-27
