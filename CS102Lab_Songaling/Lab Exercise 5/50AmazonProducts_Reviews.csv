    People said my voice wasn’t coming through like I was distant and getting cut off. Static started to be heard by others in the party. And the cord now causes static on my end and sometimes only get sound out of left ear, when I’m moving the Xbox controller and the cable gets touched. Not great quality and didn’t last long.

    Bought this due to needing something on the less expensive end to play Fortnite with my son on PS4.  These have exceeded my expectations.  Volume wheel is nice when needing to turn down and slide mute button.  If you want them to light up will need to plug into a USB port.  They still work without that.  Solid buy....

    Sound QualityThe sound quality of the headphone is good for the money, I would say for the price, I've rated it 5*. The bass is good and rich, I found them superior to in-ear headphones, which were used before these. Sound is clear, no hiss or distortion experienced.MicrophoneWhile not able to easily experience my voice at the other end of a chat, I have had no complaints about distorted sound, I can be heard well and clearly enough to chat and collaborate during gaming sessions. Having an adjustable arm for the microphone is handy to keep it out of the way while not in use.Noise cancellingWhen not active noise cancelling, they cover the ear nicely which blocks out a good deal of background noise.ComfortThe headphones adjust to a range of sizes, the padding on the over ear speakers is comfortable and can be worn for several hours while gaming, the over ear design helps to block noise helping to immerse yourself in the game.ConnectionsThere are two connections, the 3.5mm jack plug and the USB plug, the USB plug is only there to power the lights in the headphones, however the 3.5mm jack plug is essential for compatibility across my laptop and Nintendo switch. It would be nice if the sound carried over both the USB & the 3.5mm jack plug, but this is a minor point.OverallVery happy with these headphones, for the money the sound quality is very good, it is ideally setup for gaming. The built-in mic does the job well and allows me to communicate with our players well. The lights are a bonus, but don't really affect the performance of the headphones, does look good in the dark though. I would say they don't quite have the depth and range for purely listening to music, for which I have separate headphones. But for action gaming they are ideal.

    This is the first time i have purchased a headset for gaming, but i am very very impressed.  They are extremely comfortable, and really keep the outside sound out.The top of the headset has a large cushioned area for comfort on the top of the head, and the ear pieces have a very soft and comfortable padding that fit perfect around the ears.  The microphone can be moved up and down so you can move it out the way when not needed.The cable appears to be made from a very strong cloth material and not the cheap plastic cables, which im sure will last some time.  There is a inline volume control and mute flip switch on the cable which is very useful.The connection is a standard headset connection and also has a USB cable that can be used to power the headset so it lights up blue, which i don't use.Overall i am very pleased with this, so pleased infact that i brought another 2 sets for my 2 lads to use with their xbox.  Very comfortable, smart design and sound quality is brilliant and great at blocking out the external noises, superb value for money.

    Ho acquistato il prodotto per utilizzarlo alla console per giocare in chiamata, devo dire che dal punto di vista delle prestazione è davvero perfetto, i cuscinetti posti ai bordi e sopra le cuffie sono davvero comodi e confortevoli (forse durante l'estate possono risultare difficili da sopportare per via del caldo), il regolatore dell'audio e il pulsante per attivare il microfono sono posti sul cavo in giù e li trovo davvero comodi ed intuitivi, riguardo al rapporto qualità-prezzo devo dire che le ritengo le migliori che abbia mai acquistato e usato finora, consiglio l'acquisto!

    I got this in a rush when I needed a new headset. In hindsight a bit more research would have had me getting something else. As a precursor to the review I feel that it is worth noting that I am very rough on audio peripherals. I don't know why, but they usually last me about 6 months regardless of the quality and price. This is why I choose to buy at a cheaper price point more frequently rather than high-end less frequently.Pros:Price for the quality is greatDecent speaker/mic soundGood quality cable that is at least 6' longSits comfortably on the headStereo/mic to separate stereo and mic connector includedIn-line mic mute switch and audio volume adjustmentCons:The USB is only a power source for the blue lights on the headset (it is a bit misleading in its uses, but if I had researched it a bit more I would have found this out before purchase)The in-line mute and volume knob would be better with a mic gain knob as wellIt tends to make my head a bit sweaty (I have long hair and live in South Texas, US. So it is hard to find headsets that don't do that, but still something to keep in mind)The headset only goes on one way (The traditional right and left side is enforced by the mic only being usable one way. I know I am in the minority, but I like the mic being on the right side of my head)So this is absolutely worth the money, but if you are looking for a high-end headset this is not it. I know my cons were a bit nit picky, and I don't want anyone to think that I regret this purchase. I knew I was getting a quick solution to needing a headset, and I honestly got more than I was looking for. The USB lighting, while completely useless, is a cool addition. The only reason it didn't make it into the pros section is because unless you want to look cool on stream it is wasted resources.So, yea. If you want a good quality headset for a good price this is great for you.

    This item is really great for the price! I really like that I can use them on my MacBook, on my HP laptop and on the Dell PC at work. There are so many products that I can't use on my MacBook that it was exciting that these headphones worked. I haven't used them for online gaming, but they have worked great for Zoom and solo gaming.I would love if they came in green too (as that would match the rest of my setup), but at this price, and with the way they actually function, colour is pretty minor. I also found the splitter cord a bit redundant, as I couldn't tell the difference with or without it- but then again, I can't do that on my brother's 100-dollar headphones either, so maybe it is just me. They a tiny bit heavy (I'm not aa big person), but I also find that issue with any noise-cancelling headphones. At least they don't pin my glasses to my head, which has hurt me on my other set of headphones.I'm not sure what people mean by them not being stone enough (at the loudest, the volume hurts my ears bit, so they're definitely loud enough), efficient enough (they do cancel out the noise- when they're on, I can't hear my window AC unit running and my dogs sound muted) or that the mic doesn't work (it has picked up my front door opening in another room when I'm on).Overall, they were a great purchase and I would definitely recommend them.

    I've been using the G9000 headset for a few months now, and it's a solid choice for any gamer and works great for online meetings. First off, the sound quality is on point – I can hear every game detail, which ups my gaming experience. The bass surround is like being in the game! The mic is clear, and my friends hear me without any issues. It's also got this cool LED light that adds some style to my gaming setup. The only small downside is the plastic housing feels a bit cheap, but hey, it's a great deal for the price. In a nutshell, the G9000 is a winner for me.

    Auf der Suche nach einem neuen Gaming-Kopfhörer habe ich mich nach Durchsuchen des riesigen Angebotes für dieses Modell entschieden und bin mit dem Kauf sehr zufrieden.Ich habe den Kopfhörer bisher an der PS4, am PC und testweise zum Musikhören am Handy getestet.Die Soundqualität ist gut, keine Verzögerungen oder Abbrüche und die Sprachausgabe funktioniert auch reibungslos.Der Kopfhörer sitzt bequem und ist durch den verstellbaren Bügel auch für große Köpfe geeignet. Durch das Polster oben am Bügel drückt der Kopfhörer auch nicht auf dem Kopf.Das Kabel ist lang genug und hat eine praktische Bedienung für Lautstärke und Stummschaltung.Dazu sieht das Headset mit der Farbcombo schwarz, blau, silber sehr schick aus, insbesondere wenn man es per USB mit der Hardware connected.Alles in allem ein top Kopfhörer für diesen günstigen Preis. Von mir volle 5 Sterne.

    These headphones have excellent aesthetics, outstanding sound quality, estimable ergonomics and a good microphone. Everything was as advertised, and exceeded my expectations. The only downside would be that the materials are not the highest of quality in terms of durability, but that is not a problem if you care about your headphones.I was just using standard Apple earphones for everything, and I would say that these were a definite upgrade. My friends could immediately tell that I had a better quality microphone.The sound quality is also excellent. I listen to a lot of classical music, so it had to play many different elements, but it has certainly pulled through with its crisp sound.For anyone out there who may be wondering if you can use this on Apple products without the traditional headphone jack, you can, as long as you have the adapter that can convert from the lightning cable to the 3.5mm plug.Overall, I’d say it is worth more than what you pay for, and as long as you know how to handle things with care (though it would still be able to take a few good hits). I would recommend to anyone looking for good quality but affordable headphones for not only gaming, but even general purpose. I hope this was helpful.

    If you are looking for a gaming headset with a bit of everything.- The light frame(cushion on top) without access to clamping force.- Comfortable ear cushions with proper internal padding and am really happy with that because I don’t like when my ears are smashed.- Multiplatform compatibility with extra dongle available. The sound quality will be satisfied with, even I can write that for the game like call of duty(warzone), I can hear 3D sound what I mean is easy I can notice from which direction the steps coming, or glass is breaking all that kind of things that gamers find useful when they play their favourite games.- The headset has also USB but I think is only to light them up, you cannot use it for USB sound.- The mic is not removable but you have a mute button which is better because I always lose things like that.- The cable is really long I think is about 2 meters(even more).I can recommend the headset because for this price you get a headset that can compare with the expensive budget headset that cost a fortune.

    Bisher keinerle Probleme mit dem Headset gehabt. Klang ist wunderbar, besonders Bass, and es sitzt auch bei langem Tragen bequem. Hatte vor dem Kauf Bedenken beim Lautstärkeregler (Drehrad) am Kabel, funktioniert aber besten. Design ist recht simpel, Beleuchtung ist ganz hübsch aber für mich uninteressant. Laut Produktbild liegt kein 3.5mm-Audioadapter bei... bei mir allerdings schon. Sollte man also einen brauchen, eventuell auf Ankunft des Headsets warten statt im Voraus einen Adapter zu kaufen.

    Usually, I like these headphones. Bought them in the past and they were great, HOWEVER, this time I buy them? They're broken immediately. As soon as i took them out the box and tested them; one side completely just didn't work, the other was so quiet. I'm using the same brand of headphones right now, bought new ones as a replacement since these ones are almost going (I have to keep the wire in a certain place or else the sound dies in one end.) and even these ones that I have now even though like I mentioned they're breaking were better? Probably just got a bad shipment of them because like I said the ones I had before were fine.I would honestly beware on buying these, though, since I thought they were good but after this I'm very disappointed. Now I have to suffer with my old headphones that are on the verge of breaking again.

    I’m very happy with the all round quality, comfort and experience of this headset. Dita nicely over my ears and sits firm on my head without feeling like my brains are being squeezed out.Sound is phenomenal. For music, gaming and general use. Picks up so much more, sometimes disturbingly so, especially when in a spooky place in game. Music is great, bass is bassy.Quality is top notch. From m the extra long adaptable cord to the decorative stitching along the padded head band. Mic is easy to pop on, and works really well. No complaints from other players about poor quality. And is easily adjustable from the remote that’s attached to the cord (which has a clip on the back so you can pop it on your shirt) also has a handy mute button on the side.I recommend these to anyone who loves seriously good sound even without it’s extra booster button.

    Pros:1. Played Rainbow Six Siege with this headset. I could hear ash's footsteps from halfway across the map and could tell exactly where it was coming from. 10/10 for soundwhoring.2. On control panel audio devices, you should click properties for this headset and set the frequency in 'advanced' to the max because it isn't maxed by default. It improves sound quality and crispness a lot.Cons:1. It's very tight and creates this kind of suction when you put it on, which feels like when you're driving to a high mountain top and your ears start getting blocked. It's not really that uncomfortable, to be honest as you eventually forget it's there.2. The firmware updater will tell you the latest version is 0010, and that you have the newer version 0030. This is not true, Hyper X admitted that it was a mistake and that 0010 is actually the latest version. So please go to the website, download the latest firmware update even if it tells you that you're downgrading to an older version.On PS4 it might not work until you update the firmware :)3. Virtual 7.1 surround sound is both a pro and a con. For gaming, it's terrible and messes up the directional audio because it emulates and duplicates directional audio that most games already have. But when listening to some music, it can sound really good.

    Sound quality is good.Comfort can be an issue, I can only wear these for about 1.5 hours before I want to take them off. Ears/head starts to hurt.The Mic monitoring does not work. There is an option to enable/disable it within the software but it simply does not work. This is the worst part about this headset as it feels like you are wearing earmuffs and it is hard to hear your own voice when speaking which is a strange feeling.I owned the Razer Blackshark v2 before these but my cat chewed through the cord. I prefer the Razer tbh.

    My friends recommended this set and I'm not disappointed.The build quality is excellent feeling very sturdy and comfortable, the option of leather or cloth earcups is a nice addition to hopefully suit everyone (I prefer the leather cups). The weight is more than I'm used to but is still comfortable and I'd rather have a set weigh a bit more than feel light and flimsy.The microphone is adjustable thanks to a bendy wire however it doesn't have the best travel range so you can't just fold it out of your way when not in use, instead you have to unplug it which is a minor annoyance but worth noting.Audio quality is good however bass is lacking and there is no way to control how much bass the headset has, which is something much older Razer headsets had control for. I'm sure there's probably some program that can do it but no control is built in. The surround sound feature I find just muddles the audio to an extent, especially for music, so I don't find myself using it. For gaming the sound is clear and directional audio works fine, although it is a little quiet compared to general media volume, at-least for the games I have played, but this just meant raising the volume up while in-game so no issues there.Arrived very quickly, much before expected arrival date and I opted for free shipping so props to the courier for that one.Overall I'm satisfied. Much cheaper than buying it in stores and is probably the best quality (especially in build) headset for the price.

    I have used HyperX headsets since the original Cloud in 2014 and then progressed to the Alpha years later. Both of these headsets were flawless in terms of performance and comfort. Now that the leatherette band on my trusty Alpha's has started to crack/peel after many years of extensive usage, I thought I would treat myself to a wireless HyperX headset...and opted for the Cloud II Wireless.The Cloud II is a horrible step backwards from the Alpha and even to it's predecessor (original Cloud). Despite it being lightweight and comfortable AF, it's performance has been nothing but erratic and frustrating. I've never had to adjust voice chat/mic threshold settings in a game for others to hear me properly...but the Cloud II mic seems to have a mind of its own and only activates mid-sentence, even with mic sensitivity cranked up. Yet it still somehow allows a constant barrage of annoying ambient background noise through. Then without me changing a thing it will work fine for 5 mins....then back to the same issues. The speakers themselves also cut out/stuttered from time to time for no apparent reason. Another not-so-hot feature of the Cloud II is it resets the volume back to low everytime you switch them off/on (why??).As soon as I changed back to my old Alpha headset, the mic/sound issues disappeared. It's hard to tell if the Cloud II wireless is just (hyper)sensitive to RF interference or if the mic is just trash.TLDR - I got a refund for the Cloud II wireless due to very erratic mic performance/connectivity issues and opted to go back to the old faithful Alpha (which is flawless).

    Updated review after 3 years of use:Overall its a 7/10, I noticed a year of use sometimes I get loud buzzing noises or screeches that last for a second or 2 and then stop it would happen from time to time but after 3 years it is just gone. The headset overall is very comfy and good for gaming, the mic quality is very good based on feedback from my friends so happy. But after 3 years what can you expect from daily use the foam is falling apart and the mic mute, sound scroll wheel has failed completely. I paid 360 dollars for it when I got it and regret that price. I guess now for 210 dollars its still a good buy but consider my review.

    I have had 2 sets of these headphones.  The first set had the USB module die after 2 years. They were also getting tatty so I thought ah well, a new pair won't go astray :)Unfortunately, the second pair also had the USB module die.  I can still plug them into the audio jack but no surround sound any more.  They didn't even last 2 years this time and they still look nearly new as I didn't use them as much as the old pair.Comfortable, good sound, good look, just not durable.

    Though Sound and Microphone quality are fine, design and assembly introduce some real head-scratchers (what you have to do after ripping the set off when your pain threshold is exceeded).To be exceedingly fair, this set may be OK for someone with a small head and ears, like children. Straight out of the packet, the design has the earpads clamped together by the arc of spring steel. This means the wider they are forced apart, the greater the force clamping down on your skull. So, the bigger your head, the more pressure. Short of taking the risk of bending parts of the frame out of shape to relieve the pressure (voiding warranty, I am sure), you are stuck with it.To add insult to injury, the next problem is that much of this pressure bears down on your ears, not your head. Unfortunately, as elegant as an oval looks in design terms, the ear is NOT oval shaped! (unless you are a Vulcan...) So, again, unless you have very small ears, the cups will be squeezing your ears into your brain (or so it feels after a long session).To try to alleviate the discomfort, I swapped the faux leather pads for the supplied cloth alternates. What a design joke. It took half an hour of pulling and squeezing to get it done. The genius designer did not just specify a stretch rubber-type retainer that slips over the frame, but, critically, a very narrow channel, about the thickness of a finger nail, that it must slip into. This made the job of simultaneously stretching and controlling the retainer, while trying to get it to slip into its narrow resting place a real nightmare.These headphones were three times the price of my last ones (from a different maker) that I could wear with no issues for hours (sometimes forgetting I had them on). These new ones are immediately mildly uncomfortable, rising to extremely uncomfortable after an hour or so. My old ones lasted me the better part of a decade. I cannot imagine that I will tolerate these for long. Sometimes, even a friend's recommendation is not a reliable review. (I am too polite to tell him what I think, but as I have said nothing about them, I suspect he knows.....)

The only thing that kept it from a 5-star review was the size.My ears are somewhat large, so most won't have an issue, and even if you do, it's nothing major.Overall it's a great headset for listening to music, watching movies and playing games with.

I've slept in this thing many times.If I remember right the cloud 2 has the best stats among its peers for the price point.But the comfort is my favourite part. The mic is usable. I wouldn't complain if a friend used it. but I use a desk mic instead for quality.I have bought new headsets and gone back to the cloud 2.

This was a purchase I made for my eldest son, who we're getting a gaming computer built for and so he has followed what his favourite pro player uses and of course we were able to find them on the Amazon site with no trouble.He had always used a different brand previously and was a bit dubious about how these would be, but he absolutely loves this pair and said they are more comfortable, have better sound quality, better noise cancellation and more options for personal preferences. So he is a very happy chappy!!Once again, no problems with this purchase from beginning to end. So please keep up your fantastic work, as you have one very, very gratefully buyer.

Outside of this however, the 7.1 enhancement feature isn't the best for watching videos or listening to music, as it does more to distort them, whereas with video games it serves to make positioning and other noises far clearer. Aside from this, even without use of the audio enhancement feature the headset manages to impress with both audio and mic quality.

    I use this product for gaming and for work purposes, works flawlessly with discord and twitch, the 7.1 surround amp is on another level, If you play fortnite / realm / siege, it allows you to pinpoint footsteps, i almost felt like i was cheating to be honest.Music is amazing, lots of bass, i normally have to turn the headphones to max volume to enjoy my Metallica, but I found I actually had to have it on 7 - they are really really loud, which is perfect.Do yourself a favour and treat yourself to these, you wont regret it.

    I play competitive CSGO and these headphones are really well rounded and provide great comfort and sound quality at the same time. I use Sound Equalisation in Windows settings and can hear a lot in-game. I feel as if this headset is really well balanced for all in-game audio, especially compared to the Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro (which are great headphones, but for gaming I think these are better). Microphone quality is generally quite good, I had a situation where I sounded robotic, but resetting my PC alleviated that issue.

    I’m a casual gamer and compared to my old cheap Logitech headset which was more designed for zoom calls this was a HUGE upgrade. I have no frame of real reference but the ability to wander around the house while on discord waiting for a game queue is nothing short of god like. Seems very reasonably priced for how good it sounds!!

    Mainly using it for PS4 (MW, Apex, etc). Usually solo play, sometimes party chat with mates. Using it for WFH online meetings as well.Sound is great, good surround sound. Comfortable to wear during long periods (my ears fit perfectly inside). Not too heavy. Workmates say the sound is clear, although I look and sound like I'm about to report a crash on the Tulla from the helicopter.All in all - great price for this quality. Arrived almost a week earlier than expected (Melb west suburbs). Good accessories. Highly recommended for any use.

    These work great as budget headphones. The part that ruins it is the static or white noise. When no audio is playing, theres an incredibly annoying hissing sound that emanates.If you have one and you're reading this, you can test it by listening to it with no audio plugged in, then listen to it unplugged. the hissing noise disappears the moment you unplug.That noise is the one thing I absolutely hate in headphones. Such a shame. I heard incredible things about these headphones but none of them mentioned this. My razer kraken pro had this problem but it was solvable with the attached volume wheel. Was looking for a replacement for my Man o' war but i cant even return this because its a product from the UK.

    Design simple et sobre. Le produit est assez qualitatif et les écouteurs sont confortables (on peut tenir quelques heures sans sentir l'inconfort récurrent chez certains fabricants ""entrée de gamme""). En outre, le son est de bonne qualité et les oreillettes isolent assez bien de l'environnement de travail. Le microphone aurait tout de même pu être un peu mieux pensé; s'il reste correct pour ce que j'en fais, on remarque quand même le manque d'aboutissement dans sa réalisation (une simple tige en plastique....).Le raccord USB est très bien et permet d'utiliser à la fois la prise USB ou la fiche jack (sans pouvoir toutefois utiliser le régulateur manuel de son). En outre, il y a là toute les options nécessaires pour les appels etc...N-B: je regrette que le label ""made in China"" n'est pas été indiqué dans l'annonce. En outre, je trouve que le produit est très satisfaisant, mais très cher pour un produit de cette provenance. J'espère que le temps et la longévité d'utilisation viendront contredire mes premières impressions.Cependant, c'est un produit que je recommande et qui reste de loin mon casque préféré.

    I bought these to replace a basic, aging Plantronics headset.  A world of difference.  They are comfortable to wear for long periods, great sound quality as well as a good microphone.  They are not active noise cancelling and should not really be classed as noise cancelling in any shape or form... the ear covers rest on the ear so have little impact to cancelling noise from the surrounding area.Still... the clear sound, good microphone and being comfortable to wear was just what I was looking for and these fit the bill perfectly.  I do find sometimes that the microphone could do with a Windscreen Pop Filter which can be bought independently, but positioning the mic a little further away helps.

    I use this product every day. It is extremely comfortable for extended use (I use mine sometimes in excess of 5 hours at a time), and without any ear discomfort. Sound quality is perfect for my requirements; VOIP as well as watching films/TV and listening to music.The microphone yields excellent quality and people often compliment the clear sound at the other end of VOIP and broadcasts. The only very minor gripe is that moving the mic to and from the useable position is extremely noisy so you have to mute before doing so.The flexibility of both USB (for PC) and audio/jack (for phone) is welcome, although you lose the mute capability when you detach the controller, necessary for jack use.The controller is very simple to use, although I tend to only use three of the buttons (volume up and down, and mute. The busy light is a great feature though I don't have much use for it myself.The red lead from the headset to the controller is very sturdy and I've snagged it by accident a few times and without issue.The earpads feature a tilt mechanism for greater comfort that may explain why these are more comfortable than other headsets I've used.I've rated everything 5 stars, with the exception of the value for money at 4 stars. I did this only to indicate that these headsets are not as cheap as others, but in all fairness that difference in price is likely at the expense of quality in the other units.

    Das ""JABRA Evolve 40 MS Duo USB und 3,5mm Klinke"" passt gut zum Fritz-Fon C5, mit dem zusammen ich es einsetze. Die folgende Rezension beschreibt meine Erfahrungen mit dieser Kombination.Geliefert wird das Headset mit USB-Anschluss und Klinkenstecker. Der Klinkenstecker steckte bei Anlieferung im kleinen Gehäuse für die Lautstärkeregelung und die Telefonsteuerung (Mikrofon stumm schalten, Gespräche annehnmen oder beenden). Dort habe ich den Klinkenstecker abgezogen und kann ihn jetzt ins Fritz-Fon stecken. Das heißt aber auch, dass Lautstärkeregelung und Steuerung nur mit USB-Anschluss funktionieren. Steuerung und Lautstärkeregelung erfolgen übers Telefon. Für mich ist das nicht nachteilig.Der Kopfhörer sitzt bei mir gut auf dem Kopf. Ich empfinde den Sitz als bequem - auch nach dreistündigem ununterbrochenen Tragen. Für unterschiedliche Kopfformen kann man beide Muscheln bei Bedarf drehen und/oder einige Zentimeter aus dem Bügel herausziehen.Der Klang ist tatsächlich dumpf, wie es auch in einigen anderen Rezensionen zum Ausdruck kommt. Darunter kann die Verständlichkeit leiden. Am Klangbild sollte der Hersteller noch arbeiten. Schließlich ist es kein Kopfhörer für Rock- oder Pop-Musik, wo vielleicht der Bass betont sein müsste.Die Zuleitung ist in der Tat etwas steif. Sie ist aber glatt, weshalb kaum Geräusche entstehen. (Ich habe das Telefon beim Telefonieren mit Headset in der Hemdtasche und bewege mich eher wenig.)Kabellos wäre das Headset sicherlich noch bequemer zu tragen. Der Preis wäre dann vermutlich deutlich höher.Insgesamt bin ich mit dem Headset recht zufrieden. Die fehlenden Höhen beim Klang und die damit verbundenen Einbußen bei der Verständlichkeit lassen jedoch nur vier Sterne zu.

    A good quality wired (USB-A) headset. Audio quality is good and the padded ear cups provide a decent seal. The headset is reasonably light. It comes with a hardware mute button, and another button that supposedly interacts with MS teams (haven’t tried).The only small criticism I have is with the cable, it tangles up very easily as it has a natural twist, and is rubber-coated.

    Ero alla ricerca di un paio di cuffie da usare in ufficio, comode, con buona qualità audio e funzionali. Queste Jabra Evolve 40 mantengono le promesse e rispettano i requisiti che cercavo. Il plus sarebbe stato la connettività bluetooth ma bisogna andare sulle Evolve 65 con un esborso quasi doppio considerando che anche questo modello non è proprio a buon mercato. Avendo provato altre soluzioni devo dire che sono soldi ben spesi. Il prodotto è ben fatto ed anche alla vista si ha la sensazione di materiali premium. Le cuffie si indossano bene e non sono troppe pesanti. Non hanno una soppressione attiva del rumore ma solamente passiva(isolamento dato padiglione auricolare delle cuffie). Ottima anche l'integrazione con programmi di chiamata vocale online come Skype for Business/Lync con la possibilità di gestire le chiamate (rispondere, mettere in mute, regolare il volume) tramite il controller. Questa versione può essere usata sia tramite connessione USB oppure jack 3,5"" dando la possibilità di usare queste cuffie anche per telefonate tramite cellulare. Prodotto altamente consigliato.

    I love Jabra products, we use the conference call device in the office.These headphones are definitely worth it. Bass response is great when listening to music. The passive noise cancellation makes working in the office a little better, although I would prefer to upgrade to some active cancellation. The mic noise cancellation I think is very good, with callers remarking that it sounds like I'm working in a library and not a busy open plan office.However, I have two fairly minor niggles the spoil my enjoyment a little:1. The cable/lead is quite rigid and hard to the touch. Which equates to it audibly banging in your ear, even when it brushes against your shoulder you can hear it through the right headphone. It's rigidity means that it splays out in a wide coil and doesn't just fall to the side. It gets in the way and is quite annoying. Audiophiles beware.2. Not a game changer, but disappointing for such a great product. The microphone is supposed to clip away onto the headband. It does this magnetically, but the magnet is extremely weak. The mic base is attached to the right earpiece and when it twists to fit your ear, the mic will instantly pop off the headband.It's still a high quality product, but if you are niggled by small details I'd look elsewhere.

    リモートワークでの会議用に購入しました。比較的頭が大きい方で、ゲーム用に使っているLogicoolのG535はギリギリのサイズ感だったりしたのでサイズが合うか心配でしたが、アジャスターの伸び幅が大きく余裕でした。Teams連携モデルなので、手元のボタンで着信応答出来るのは便利です。少し硬めのケーブルもクセがつきにくくて私は好きです。マイクが左右自在かつ、使わない時はヘッドバンド部にマグネットで格納されるのも良いですね。マイクの感度も問題なく、環境音もいい感じにフィルタしてくれているようです。会話用なので音質はあまり期待していませんでしたが、試しに音楽を聴いてみると思いのほか良いです。中音域重視で高音低音は抑えめなバランスですが、解像度が非常に高く粒の立った音質です。かなり気に入ってしまって、あまり悪いところが見つからないのですが、強いていうならバンド部やケーブルの赤色が朱色よりの発色なのが残念、もう少し真紅や深い赤色ならもっと格好良いのに。お値段だけのことはある、満足度の高い商品だと思います。

    Ho acquistato le cuffie Jabra Evolve 40 Stereo MS (85 €) per il remote working in sostituzione di un paio di MPOW PA071A (30 €) che si era danneggiato nel cerchietto sopra la testa e nella cucitura dei cuscinetti dopo un anno e mezzo di utilizzo intenso.Sia le Jabra che le MPOW sono cablate, hanno i cuscinetti in simil pelle, il telecomando, l'attacco jack, l'attacco USB A, ecc. In più, le Jabra hanno un peso minore (116 g vs 172 g), hanno migliori prestazioni audio, hanno la cancellazione passiva del rumore, sono integrate con Teams, sono dotate di busy light ed è possibile mettere ""a riposo"" l'archetto del microfono grazie ad un magnete che lo ancora al cerchietto. Il costo comprende una custodia Jabra.

    Das Headset hat eine sehr gute Tonqualität, was - neben dem Tragekomfort - das Wichtigste am Headset ist.Ich persönlich finde den Tragekomfort ebenfalls sehr gut, wobei ich die Kritiken verstehen kann, dass es einigen zu wenig Polsterung ist. Da das Headset aber ausgesprochen leicht ist, habe ich hier kein Problem.Die Verarbeitung ist relativ gut, nicht aber ganz so toll, wie es aussieht: An den beweglichen Teilen ist das Plastik doch etwas ""billig"". Mal sehen, wie lange das Headset beim vielen Rein-in-die-Tasche-raus-aus-der-Tasche hält.Für den Schutz gibt es eine eine separate schützende Neopren-Tasche. Damit sind auch die unten stehenden Kritiken bezüglich der Geruchsbelästigung erklärt. Der Neoprengeruch der Tasche haftet tatsächlich ein wenig für einen längeren Zeitraum an den Kopfhörern an. Ich kann es nachvollziehen, dass das stört. Ich als Surfer kann man das aber leicht ignorieren ;-)

    I am pleasantly surprised by the quality of this headset. I use it on both my PC and PS4 (3D Audio enabled). Coming from a neat 5.1ch speaker setup on the PC and a beefy 7.2ch with the PS4, I expected to be disappointed by a budget wireless headset, but thankfully all the reviews are right! It delivers great sound, is very accessible, and budget-friendly.I'm sure there are better options out there if you're already in the headset scene and looking for new one to try, but I definitely recommend this one for anyone just looking to enjoy some immersion without disturbing the peace of the house.

    Owned Razer headsets in the past and found them very good so wasn’t let down with this headset.Purchased to use with the ps5 works well just plug and play.Purchased another set for my son to play on his switch.Great little headset very comfortable to wear nice snug fit. Light headset not heavy. Great sound crisp clear.The design of this headset blends in doesn’t look like a gaming headset can remove the microphone and wear out and about while on the go gaming and to listen to Music. Very pleased with this headset you get a lot of features for under $100 money well spent especially for a wireless headset. Keep in mind this is the 2021 older model doesn’t have Bluetooth. The new version 2022 model has Bluetooth. The only thing I could say about this headset is would have been nice if it came with a small cloth pouch to place the headset in when not in use.

    The headphone component of the headset is quite good. Comfortable, decent range (though more for gaming than music) and the range of the wireless is excellent. The microphone is truely disappointing though. It is has such a low sensitivity that it has to be physically touching your face to pick up, and even then the input strength is at times not loud enough to overcome the noise supporession on common voice tools like discord and google meets. I bought these hoping to use them for both gaming, and video conference meetings, but I have had to revert to using my wired headphones for video conferencing and these purely for gaming (where I do not require a headset).

    First time buyer of a headset as I'm getting into gaming and wanted a headset that I could hear everything clearly through without disturbing my hubby. Well, this is it for me! Can use with or without aux cord, and with transceiver for wireless play. Sound is a surround with a deep tone that allows you to hear everything clearly. Very goods for the price - got this set on special when they were under $100. Only downfall is that I should have bought more sets at that price! I love them!

    These are a great pair of wireless headphones for a console - and if I didn't already have a Sony-branded pair, I'd probably be gushing unreservedly.I'm a big fan of the USB-C charging, the charge lasts forever, the volume wheel is great and they're very comfortable.  The downside is the power-on button takes a while to work (possibly to stop accidental pushes, but why not quick on / slow off?).  That's fine, but my big gripe is it mutes the other audio outputs from my PS5 if the USB transmitter is plugged in, even if the headset is off.As mentioned, I'm contrasting this against the older PS Gold headset that I've carried over from my PS4.  If that headset isn't switched on, its USB transmitter doesn't affect the HDMI output to the soundbar.  Switch them on, and the soundbar mutes and you get an on-screen battery indicator for the headset, which is neat.  Switch them off again and the audio goes back to the soundbar.  I don't necessarily expect third party devices to transmit battery data back, but the muting is annoying, particularly as the Razer transmitter dongle is tight and I worry about its longevity if I'm pulling it in and out frequently.That said, I'll keep using it as it's more comfortable than the Sony headset and the volume wheel is more intuitive than the million-and-one buttons on the Sony earcup.

    It seems Amazon is selling the older version, at least the one I got is. RZ04-03780.You can identify this by the dongle design (see photo I attached)This headset works perfectly with the wired USB C to 3.5mm cable, and sounds great and mic is super quality.!However problems appear when you connect via the USB C dongle wirelessly.It connects within a second and works fine with headphone sound, however the mic volume is so low, even when you have mic turned up to 100% from windows sound options in the control panel.I uninstalled and re-installed drivers too. then I upgraded the firmware on both dongle and headset to the latest. Still the Mic volume is way too low.In one occasion it disconnected on me and had to re-connect manually to get working.I will monitor this behavior and return this if it continues to do so.

    Después de 4 meses de uso puedo decir que me encantan.No los he usado muchas horas seguidas, ha sido de forma más ocasional (un par de horas 4 o 5 días a la semana). Me parecen muy cómodos y ligeros y no me ha resultado pesado su uso, al menos de momento. Tampoco se han desgastado ni se han roto las almohadillas ni la diadema y tampoco el micro (y no lo tengo siempre puesto, lo pongo y lo quito según lo necesito).Los he conectado a varias plataformas (ps4, ps5, Nintendo Switch, pc y teléfono). Son muy versátiles, aunque puede ser incómodo conectar el receptor a ciertos dispositivos (en el móvil se nota bastante, por ejemplo, y en el modo portátil de la switch también... aunque ahí molesta menos y solo estorba para el modo sobremesa). El receptor es una conexión USB-C, pero trae también un adaptador a USB, así que no supone un problema grave. Sí es cierto que sería mucho mejor que tuvieran conexión a través de bluetooth, pero yo tampoco lo he echado en falta (tal vez quien utilice dispositivos de Apple sí deba tenerlo en cuenta).El sonido está bien y el micrófono capta el audio también de una forma bastante nítida. Si vienes de unos auriculares de 20€ a estos, notarás bastante la diferencia... pero si esperas más, deberías buscar en gamas superiores.La batería dura bastante, yo los he cargado como mucho una vez por semana. También se apagan solos si no detectan aplicaciones o juegos activos reproduciendo sonido durante unos minutos, al menos cuando están conectados en el ordenador.En definitiva, dan lo que prometen en cuanto a versatilidad y comodidad y su relación calidad-precio es buena, pero no esperes lo mismo que te dan otros de gamas más altas.

    Ich hab das Headset vor ca. 7 Monaten für 45€ gekauft und es ist das beste das ich bis jetzt hatte.Positiv:+ Im Gegensatz zu einigen Bewertungen hier hat bis jetzt jeder gesagt, dass sie mich über Teamspeak perfekt verstehen und ich auch nicht dumpf o.ä. klinge.+ Der Klang des Headsets ist sehr angenehm. Auch die Bässe und Stimmen hören sich satt und klar an.+ Das Headset funktioniert Wireless und hat eine große Reichweite. Selbst wenn ich von meinem PC in die Küche gehe, bricht die Verbindungen nur selten ab. Sind gute 10 Meter.+ Lässt sich easy aus und anschalten mit Hilfe von dem Powerknopf direkt am Headset, mit dem man bei kurzem Drücken auch Pause/Play bei Youtube Videos oder Musik machen kann.+ Mikrophon kann ausgesteckt werden, falls man mal nicht mit anderen redet oder einen Film gucke/ Musik hört+ Kopfbügel kann einfach verstellt werden und ist hochwertig.+ Das Polster der Ohrmuschel lässt sich abmachen, damit man es sauber machen kann und die Muschel umschließt das ganze Ohr, so dass das Headset selbst nach einigen Stunden nicht unbequem wird.+ Akku hält ca. 15-20 Stunden wenn er vollgeladen ist.+ Sieht gut aus. Schlichtes Schwarz mit dem Razer Logo auf der SeiteNegativ:- Wenn das Headset nicht eng eingestellt ist, kann es bei schnellen Kopfbewegungen verrutschen, allerdings fliegt es nicht runter.- Ist zwar Wireless, allerdings nicht über Bluetooth, sondern über einen USB-C Stecker, der mit einem Empfänger verbunden werden muss

    J'utilise ce casque pour jouer à mes jeux pc, mais aussi pour mes appels, et écouter ma musique bref pour tout. Le son est vraiment bien.Positif : léger, prix raisonnable, joli finition, micro et écouteur de bonne qualité, la qualité des câbles est juste top.Négatif : le support bleutooth est trop large, mais du coup j'ai acheté pour quelques euros un hup usbc mâle femelle usbc avec deux femelles, et une mini rallonge usbc mâle usbc femelle pour pouvoir connecter le casque et un chargeur de smartphone en même temps car j'utilise beaucoup mon smartphone. Et pour mon pc qui possède un port femmelle usbc je peux donc le connecter directement, après si je veux être en internet je me sert de la mini rallonge usbc sinon le support bleutooth ne passe pas.Personnellement pour mon utilisation ce caque me convient parfaitement car ces inconvénients ne me gêne pas à moi mais peuvent gêner d'autre personnes.

    Pros: Affordable, Lightweight/Comfortable, Mute Button, Plug and Play, Long Battery Life, Classically Simple DesignCons: Average Sound, Cheap Microphone, Low Wireless Range, Not Very LoudThe headphones are great if you're looking for a modern wireless headset with all the necessary features.It's got a noise cancelling mic, a wireless receiver, a mute button, a volume wheel, breathable earcups and a sturdy lightweight build.The earphones don't get super loud, the volume wheel is extremely limited and the wireless signal does not go anywhere past the room you have the receiver in unless you use the extension. Which is fair but some other headphones on the market do a much better job of reaching other rooms.Still it's easy to forget these headphones are £99 which is the perfect price in my opinion. Some things like the sound quality, the simple design and not so premium microphone hold it back. But it's a great bang for the buck. This is a very solid headset with no frills and gimmicks.Well except one gimmick, they claim you can use these with your smartphone, not iPhones however so bear that in mind. You can plug the USB C receiver into your phone and enjoy them like normal headphones, there's no carrying case however so the microphone and cables stay at home.If you need a decent pair of wireless headphones with modern connectivity and comfort as the focus. Buy them.

    This works great on my PlayStation 5 and XboxSX but when I’ve finished using it on my PC I basically have to go through Bluetooth devices and device manager to remove it so I can go back to using regular speakers again. This is a real pain so I bought a HyperX set for the PC and that’s a lot easier to remove. Other than that the quality is really good.

    They sound fine. Very ""punchy"" sound I guess you'd call it. Many gamers would like this. A bit over the top for my taste.I have a MASSIVE gripe with the software and am super pissed-off to the point where I quite like these headphones but will NEVER buy another Steel Series so long as I live. The software goes by the ridiculous name ""GG"" and has a module called ""Sonar"" where all the audio shapiing features reside.You have to create an account to use the Sonar module, therefore you have to create an account to use GG. This can only be because because Steel Series are harvesting every single bit of data about you they possibly can. The main purpose of GG is to load some spyware on to your PC and report on your gaming habits (possibly other habits) to Steel Series.Sonar can make the ohones sound alright but there's WAY TOO MUCH messing around to get things right. They sound AWFUL out of the box, so there's a lot of audio manipulation to get them usable. There's some BS ""AI"" feature that does nothing I can discern but I guess the marketing department says AI is so hot right now so we need to have ""AI"" headphones to go with our ""AI"" washing machines, dryers, refrigerators, toasters, blah blah blah.My gaming buddies tell me the mic sounds great which is awesome but be warned - the mic is EXTREMELY sensitive so you need to turn the threshold RIGHT  UP in the Sonar feature of GG or your gaming colleagues will hear every rustle and scratch you make.And they're very light and quite comfortable. I'm concerned about the build quality but time will tell.

    Overall, the sound has been great for games like Escape from Tarkov using the setting for the game within the Sonar software. Positional audio and sound quality in general are really good.Battery life is much lower than expected. Expect to have to charge every night and also likely during the day if you're using them for a full day + at night. A firmware update made my battery life much shorter which was disappointing. Hopefully a future update will help with this.Microphone, as expected, is relatively average but is definitely serviceable for gaming. Just be aware that it will move itself sometimes due to being retractable and that a small movement in the mic will make your voice significantly quieter which can be annoying at times (classic Steelseries mic problems).

    I've got this too use with my PS5. Out of the box impression were really good. However, after using it for 15 minutes, I've started noticing some weird sound profile, as though as you're playing underwater.When the sound is being delivered properly, it's amazing but when it starts playing up, it becomes weird and annoying.Connected to the PC, installed the SteelSeries GG (latest update), and there was a critical firmware update available. And that's where the issue is. Good luck trying to get it updated.When you click on the update, it'll detect if the headset is connected (via the USB-C dongle), I get that the headset is connected but the ""update firmware"" button is greyed out.I've tried all possible troubleshooting steps like:- Waiting the headset to fully charge- Disconnecting/connecting the headset- Trying on a different computer- Uninstalling/reinstalling the SteelSeries GG software.Nothing have made it to update.Next step, was to try to get to support. Virtually non existent. Or maybe, literally non existent.There's no ""contact us"", even though there's a button, you just go to an FAQ page. Nothing there actually explains what to do in case you're unable to update your headset.On their discord server, it's the same. They ask you that before raising a ticket (which you can't anyway), to read the FAQ, and if you still need help, reach out to the community support (community mind you).Created a post, no replies (not surprising because it's a community support) not an actual support, a week goes by and still no support, even after tagging the person who created the support page on discord.I did a bit of research and other people are complaining about the same thing. You can first do a research on the headset and you'll see review sites mentioning the weird sound profile, and other users complaining about issues and lack of support on Reddit.My advice, just stay away from this headset, or SteelSeries altogether because when you need support, you will not find it.

    I wanted to raise the max volume because it's too quiet out of the box. However, I'm forced to install Steelseries' bloated, resource-heavy software that's clearly designed to market their other hardware. Unfortunately, in the end, it didn't even recognise the headset when I had it plugged in by USB so I couldn't raise the volume. Besides the headache of that software, the sound quality and mic quality aren't anything special. Not worth the price. Bloated price point because its 'gamer gear'. Kicking myself that I got sucked in. This is the last time I'll buy gamer-specific gear, never again. Would return this rubbish if I could.

    I watched many reviews on YouTube and they all say it is a good headset because of all the extra features, but it turns out that the two main functions of it which is the audio quality and mic quality is just worse than many cheap headsets. the comfort is probably the worst thing, it gets hot, is terrible for VR as it just slides off my ears and for some reason they added some heavy metal to the top of the head strap. There was also no mention anywhere that they are noise cancelling.

    Le casque SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7X propose une expérience audio complète. Son design allie confort et esthétique, offrant une expérience agréable pour les longues sessions d'utilisation. La qualité sonore est impressionnante, offrant une immersion totale dans les jeux, la musique ou les films. La connectivité aisée facilite la mise en place.Le seul bémol réside dans le logiciel accompagnant le casque, SteelSeries GG. Bien qu'il offre des possibilités étendues pour personnaliser le son selon les applications, j'ai constaté quelques bugs gênants. En particulier, un problème où le son cesse de sortir du casque. Espérons que SteelSeries adresse ces problèmes avec des mises à jour logicielles à l'avenir.Malgré ces inconvénients, le casque Arctis Nova 7X reste une excellente option. Si vous pouvez faire abstraction des problèmes logiciels occasionnels, c'est un choix solide.PS : On a même une petite construction cubique en carton à faire ! Une petite déco bien mignonne.

    The headset is super comfortable, more so than the Hyper X Cloud 2 that I used to use. The battery life is great and you can use it wired if need be as well as use it whilst charging.The software (Steel Series GG) offers really good sound equaliser options along with multiple profiles. There is a ChatMix option where as you can turn a dial on the right ear to incrimentally change the volume between the game sound and chat software (I use Discord). This is ideal for when you want to concentrate on the game sound rather than your friends conversations.The headset can be connected to the PC wirelessly, and simultaneously the Bluetooth connection can be used to connect to your phone so you can take calls or listen to your own music whilst gaming.In all this is a fantastic headset and well worth the £129 I paid.

    Super happy with this purchase!Sound quality: Top tier, no complaints at all when gaming, wether in chat with friends or playing solo, brilliant at low or high volume also! The 360 spatial audio is wicked on loads of different games too.Comfort: Great! I can where them for an extended period of time and have no trouble. Also, the size extender is easy to use also with a good range.Battery: No issues with battery levels, they last for a good few days before needing a charge and it charges quickly.Features: The microphone pull out is great, it can easily be put back away when not needed which I love. The mic mute is great too with the LED indicator. The party/game volume wheel is a good addition, very handy to have.Connectivity/the Dongle: It connected super easily to my computer, it updated and prompted the software download for me. Then when switching to Xbox it was just as easy and worked perfectly, right away.I’ll also add, making the switch to a wireless headset is brilliant and you should definitely go for it if you’re on the fence, yes they’re a bit more pricey but it’s 100% worth it in my opinion!

    Le uso da circa 2 settimane.Possiedo diversi modelli di cuffie, cablate ( Sennheiser HD 599, le mie preferite in assoluto !! e HyperX Cloud Alpha S ) e wireless ( Sony pulse 3d, discreto suono ma mille volte piu scomode.. )Importante aggiornarle collegandole ad un pc ( nel dongle spostare il tastino su usb o non le rileverà ) e disattivare il limitatore del volume dal software steelseries, essenziale.Qualche piccola modifica all'equalizzatore e prenderanno letteralmente vita.Attivato anche il Dolby su series x.Buon suono, forte e limpido.Possibile aumentare dall'equalizzatore i bassi che possono diventano belli possenti, io ho preferito un suono bilanciato aumentando leggermente i bassi.Le impostazioni del software steelseries gg vengono salvate nella cuffia per essere effettive anche su xbox.Questo non vale per il software sonar, effettivo solo su pc.Durata batteria eccezionale.Comode e leggere, ci si dimentica di averle addosso !Collegamento con bluetooth contemporaneo anche con il wi-fi veloce e senza problemi ( il volume si regola dal dispositivo collegato per il bluetooth, rotella nel padiglione sinistro per il wi-fi ).Cosa importante e comodissima: La console non si accende con le cuffie, quindi è possibile accenderle per usarle con un cellulare o tv in bluetooth senza avviare la console.Collegamento wi-fi con il dongle che non mi si è mai disconnesso o dato distorsioni di sorta.E' possibile comunque usarle anche con jack 3,5 ( cavo incluso )Insomma soddisfatto, valgono il loro prezzo.Unica cosa resta da vedere se dureranno...i precedenti modelli steelSeries arctics tendevano a rompersi fin troppo spesso nel collegamento con i padiglioni....spero abbiano migliorato questo punto debole.Per sicurezza le indosso prendendole dall'archetto per non sforzare il collegamento archetto/padiglione auricolare e le lascio un pelo larghe.Spero durino visto che hanno tutto quello che cercavo senza ( per ora ) alcun problema.Spedizione amazon veloce come sempre, ma la confezione delle cuffie è stata impacchettata senza nessuna imbottitura nel pacco, quindi era libera di sbattere su e giu durante il viaggio...fortunatamente nessun danno.

    Po prawię miesiącu użytkowania i przesiadce z krakenów v2 mogę z czystym sumieniem polecić te słuchawki jeżeli łączą się z PC lub konsolami przez adapter, jeżeli chodzi o bluetooth'a to dźwięk jest płytszy ale i tak dają radę. Słuchawki bez zainstalowanego oprogramowania ""SteelSeries GG"" brzmią bardzo dobrze jednak pełną moc osiągają po odpaleniu ""Sonara"" i krótkiej zabawie z equalizer'em, można też wybrać gotowy profil pod konkretną grę, oprogramowanie oferuje również włącznie dźwięku przestrzennego co jest bardzo przydatne w różnego rodzaju FPS'ach. Jedyne co mnie trochę rozczarowało to fakt że słuchawki były wcześniej otwarte, prawdopodobnie były po zwrocie. W pudełku brakowało kartonowego ludzika do złożenia. Jako że zależało mi na słuchawkach a te wyglądały jak nowe, nie nosiły śladów użytkowania i grają bardzo dobrze to nie zwracałem ich.Na plus:+ długa praca na baterii około 45h, korzystając tylko przez połączenie z adapterem+ bardzo lekkie i wygodne+ dość dobry zasięg+ możliwość grania, oglądania i jednoczesnego rozmawiania przez telefon+ grają bardzo dobrze bez oprogramowania, wystarczy załączony adapter+ przy rozładowanych słuchawkach podłączenie do ładowania na 15 min daje jakieś 5-6h użytkowania+ dużo przycisków, pokręteł funkcyjnych na samych słuchawkachNa minus:- przy połączeniu przez bluetooth'a dźwięk może rozczarować

    Das SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7X hat meine Erwartungen für ein Wireless Gaming-Headset wahrlich übertroffen.

Es ist großartig, dass ich nicht mehrere Headsets für verschiedene Plattformen benötige. Egal, ob ich auf dem PC spiele oder meine Freunde auf der PS4 herausfordere, dieses Headset bietet immer eine beeindruckende Klangqualität.Die Klangqualität ist wirklich erstklassig. Die Audioleistung ist klar, ausgewogen und lebendig. Die Bässe sind tief, die Höhen sind klar und die Mitten sind gut definiert. Das trägt zu einem immersiven Spielerlebnis bei, egal ob ich in einem Actionspiel unterwegs bin oder mich in ein Story-getriebenes Abenteuer vertiefe.Die kabellose Verbindung ist stabil und zuverlässig. Ich hatte keine Probleme mit Verbindungsabbrüchen oder Störungen, selbst in hektischen Multiplayer-Spielen.Der Tragekomfort ist ebenfalls bemerkenswert. Die Ohrpolster sind weich und bequem, und das verstellbare Kopfband sorgt dafür, dass das Headset perfekt auf meinen Kopf passt, ohne zu drücken.Die Akkulaufzeit ist beeindruckend. Ich kann stundenlang spielen, ohne mir Sorgen um einen leeren Akku machen zu müssen.

    Got this because my Old Arctis 7 headset finally broke. I decided the best option was to go for the Nova 7, because the Pro was double the cost.Overall, this headset performs great. I can tell the audio quality has improved slightly, as well as the Bluetooth being a huge plus, as I can play Music from my phone, and talk with my friend over discord on my PC. You can also just take the headset anywhere, on planes etc, unlike the arctis 7's.There are some downsides to this headset. The main for me is the design. I feel this headset is not as minimalist and stylish as the Arctis 7's, it feels a little bulkier, however it's still very lightweight and the standard headset cushions are very good for breathability. I would actually recommend these over the Nova Pros because I have read many people sweat inside the tight leather seal of those.The use of USBC is also great, I love that they have simplified the charging and now we no longer need a micro-usb cable to charge the headset. The headset band has some adjustability if you have a large head, and there is a degree of customization if you like that.Overall a solid product, and definitely feels like an upgrade from the Arctis 7's. I was a little disappointed these were not available in white as my setup is white, but you can probably buy some kits to customize that. If you have the money, go for the Nova Pro, but for most, the Nova 7 is a completely adequate and justifiable upgrade. 9/10.

    Le premier casque sans fil que j'ai acheté de ma vie, n'ayant jamais eu confiance en cette technologie, la pensant trop peu fiable.Et bien je me suis lourdement trompé, ce casque est excellent !Très bonne autonomie, pas de déconnexions intempestive, très bon son et bon micro.Ses fonctionnalités sans fil Wifi et Bluetooth sont très pratique pour travailler ou jouer sur le PC tout en pouvant passer un appel; d'ailleurs la molette permettant de baisser le son d'une appli pour n'avoir que le son de l'appel est super, pas besoin de stopper le son manuellement sur le PC.La recharge est relativement rapide en USB-C et ses différents canaux sont très pratiques pour bien différencier les applications entre elles.Question confort, je peux garder ce casque durant des heures sans avoir mal au crâne et ses coussinets de base sont très confortables.Le + de ce casque qui donne un touche très agréable à l'ensemble : La possibilité de changer beaucoup d'éléments facilement ! (la bande d'arceau, les oreillettes et les coupoles sur le côté, bien que les coupoles soient purement esthétiques)En un tour de main vous pouvez personnaliser et améliorer le confort du casque sans trop de manipulations compliquées, et c'est un point non négligeable !Petit bémol uniquement dû à mon boitier (un Corsair Crystal), le dongle USB-C permettant la connxion est si large que cela me bloque un port USB-A.

    Wcześniej korzystałem z Steelseries Arctis 7 więc w porównianiu Nova 7 wypadają kilka razy lepiej. Jest kilka plusów które zaobserwowałem po tygodniu korzystania:1. Żywotność baterii starcza na dużo dłużej.2. Dźwięk w tych słuchawkach to po prostu mistrzostwo, słuchanie muzyka stało się jeszcze przyjemniejsze jak na słuchawki przeznaczone głównie do gier dla mnie bomba.3.

    Ho provato altre cuffie prima di trovare quella che fa davvero per me.Comoda: non da mai fastidio e puoi tenerla per ore senza sudare né sentire fastidioPerformante: il doppio collegamento da una parte con la Xbox e dall'altra con il telefono permette di essere sempre collegato contemporaneamente con il gioco e con il mondo e perché no puoi ascoltare la tua musica.

    Voy a intentar resumirlo.Lo bueno:Los auriculares me parecen espectaculares. Vengo de unos Logitech Pro X y estos me parecen mejores. Lo de poder mezclar el sonido del bluetooth con el del dongle me parece genial, puedo tener el discord en PC y el audio de la Switch al mismo tiempo, o estar jugando al PC y coger llamadas sin tener que quitarme los auriculares.En cuanto a materiales se sienten bastante premium, con metal y plásticos buenos y sólidos. Lo único que me parece débil es el micrófono, pero el tiempo lo dirá.La batería dura muchísimo, no es el que más pero no puedo quejarme, me dura la semana entera y un poco más sin problema.Son bastante cómodos, puedo estar horas jugando y no hacen daño ni me molestan, aunque hay un pero que comentaré ahora.Lo malo:Aunque sean cómodos no se fijan bien a la cabeza. Si miro hacia abajo mientras hago cosas por casa, me da la sensación de que se me van a caer. No se caen, pero quedan flojos y se mueven algo. Además lo de poder girar los altavoces em su propio eje nunca me ha gustado, me cuesta un rato quedarme cómodo.Por otro lado, como otro punto negativo, es la aplicación de Steelseries Sonar. Es lo más complicado que he visto en mi vida. Una vez lo instala te crea un montón de salidas de audio, una para gaming, otra para media, otra para chat y otra que ya ni recuerdo que era, y crea un par para la entrada de audio.Cada vez que inicio el ordenador me vuelvo loco para intentar escuchar el discord, cuando consigo eso me cuesta horrores escuchar el juego porque sale por otro lado, un horror. Al final he optado por usar la propia salida básica de los auriculares e ignorar sonar, he activado dolby atmos y a correr, ni he jugado con el ecualizador porque no quiero tener lío cada vez que quiero sentarme un rato al PC.En resumen, los aconsejo pero si no tenéis paciencia para la app pasad de la parte de Sonar.Por cierto, si no os lo detecta es porque el dongle seguramente esté en modo Xbox (si la luz está en verde), hay un pequeño botón que cambia la luz a blanca y ese es el modo PC. Una vez hagáis esto ya os detectará y podréis desactivar desde la aplicación (en la parte de Engine) el ChatMix que me parece horrible.

    After my previous reptilian headset randomly died, I hopped onto the Steel Series Nova 7X after hearing good things.Straight out of the box, plugged dongle into xbox and everything came alive, quite effortless.The headset is a tidy piece of kit, feels good in hand and for the price I think it's what you'd hope for, no sense of cheap plastic.Initial impressions in use, it sounds good but the bass feels flat/restrained, not something I'd expect in a headset with this price tag but equally ""Gamer"" audio is often tuned for the high end details to find footsteps etcI also found a lack of mic monitoring a little jarring at first, unable to decide if I'm shouting in the outside world or not.Jumping onto the play store to find the steelseries app, assuming I can tweak things..after multiple search terms etc I found no such app.After hitting Google, it seems I need to plug the USB dongled into my PC and download the SteelSeries GG app (skippable registration)From there I was able to set the headset EQ, and just using one of the presets (i liked ""Smiley"") the headset absolutely came into its own.. bass strong enough I felt the headset vibrate on my head, while delivering crisp highs, also in my clicking around I was able to turn off a volume limiter (probably best left turnee on, it can get painfully loud!) And while I saw no direct toggle for it I also seem to have turned on mic monitoring.In use, comfort is very good though I did find it made my ears feel quite warm, it's also a 27c day so I'll not pin that on the headset.All in all, excellent headset far superior to my previous but its 2023 and Steelseries doesn't have a mobile app for it? What on earth!!!

    All round a great improvement over the already great previous Artics headphones. Better build quality, more comfortable, better Bluetooth connectivity, better sound, USB C, better battery life and they have the ability to be paired with other consoles (so you’re no longer limited to wireless only with Xbox or PS).By default they are a little quiet as there’s a software volume limiter on which you can switch off this off when connected to their app on PC.Problems start when the volume limiter is off though as you’re able to hear clearly that the audio level and sound quality isn’t as good in the left ear cup, when the volume is high enough the sound in left ear cup is slightly distorted and it gives of a very faint static sound (which isn’t present in the right), on lower volumes these issue is barely noticeable - but once heard you can’t unhear.I returned my first pair and had the same problem with the second pair, some research on Reddit suggests this is a known issue.

    I used to use Corsair Virtuoso XT. The good thing about those headphones is that they pair with two BT devices and the wireless/radio (PC). But, only one BT can ""talk"" at given time. However, after 8-9 months of usage, I've had some serious battery trouble with the Corsair. The support told me just to return them, so after some tests (I liked them, did not want to return, but I could not get them to work properly) - I did.This is when my gamer friends recommended the Arctis 7 headset. Since I use it for working too, I had to get the Arctis Nova 7 one (there are multiple 7 models, the difference is compatibility apparently, pc/xbox/ps - so make sure to check before you buy! I'm on just plain arctis nova 7, which works with PCs and BT just fine).The battery life on this baby is vastly superior to Corsairs (think ~7 hours vs around 1.5-2 days on Arctis), the delay should be the same (check before you buy!), the features include everything I need.Arctis Nova 7 pairs easily with my phone, works out of the box with my PC, you don't need the Sonar software thing either. Even EQ works without it. The only thing I wish this headset had was more than just 4 choices for the ""microphone echo"". the lowest one above 0 is a bit too loud for my liking. But other than that, I really, really like that headset. So far absolutely 0 problems with that. It is also pretty light and the headband is adjustable, which was not the case with Corsair.Oh, I wish it could display the charge in resolution higher than 1/4 (i.e. empty, 25%, 50%, 75%, full), but the Corsair ones were the same.I am very happy with that headset, I loved Corsair Virtuoso XTs, but if you do not need to pair with two BT devices, this one is just cheaper and better.

    Lo primero me gustaría decir que en casa tengo unos Logitech g733 y un Sennheiser HD 560s, partiendo de esa base puedo hacer un análisis más o menos precisoComodidad- me parecen bastante cómodos, no tanto como el g733 donde clasificaría a estos últimos con un 9/10,  y a los artics con un 8.5/10, dejando en último lugar los hd590s con un 6/10 ya que no son cómodos para largas sesiones y se sienten muy duros, ambos(Logitech y steelseries) con un acolchado viscoelástico, aunque los artics aprietan un poco más la cabeza, pero podrás estar horas sin que te molesten(para una cabeza mediana) decir que los g733 son rígidos y los artics puedes girar el auricular y quedan relativamente cómodos cuando nos lo quitamos y lo dejamos reposar en el cuelloSonido- me ha sorprendido bastante ya que suena mejor que los g733 y no mucho peor que los hd560s, no soy un experto en cuanto a sonido pero es perceptible la diferencia entre estos cascos mencionados, en general un sonido limpio y bastante más neutral que los g733 con un volumen a mi parecer bastante alto tanto para jugar, como ver películas y escuchar música, mi nota seríaLogitech g733 7.5/10Artics nova 7 8/10HD 560s 8.5/10(este tiene sonidos muy planos que quizás a muchos no les guste)Calidad de construcción- muy correctos, con una mezcla entre plástico y metal da la sensación de robustez, se sienten más pesados que los g733 pero hay que tener en cuenta que los de Logitech hicieron unos cascos ultraligeros, espero que me duren bastante, 8/10 para artics nova 7Bateria- aqui lo doy un 9/10, con una carga de 15 min tienes para 6hr y en menos de 2hr tienes la carga completa con una duración de 30hr aprox, según el volumen y uso que le des podrá ser más o menos, simplemente excelente!, Tienes unos leds que según los colores indican el estado de su batería aunque no son precisos, para ver con exactitud el nivel de batería, debes descargar la app de la marca.Software y conectividad- estos auriculares se puede conectar también a través de bluetooth con lo cual, podrás estar jugando a tu juego favorito en el pc y escuchar las notificaciones del móvil y con una distancia que llega un poco más allá que los Logitech g733, en cuanto a la app de steelseries al principio puede ser un poco lioso aunque tiene varios preset que puedes elegir a tu gusto, además, tienes para dar volumen independiente y elegir entre escuchar más fuerte a tus compañeros de partida o el juego(para esta opción debes tener instalada la app, si no, no funciona..)Si quieres prescindir de la app, solo tendrás que conectar y disfrutar.

    Prese usate in ottime condizioni e devo dire che valgono tutto il prezzo pagato. Sono comode, suonano bene, hanno una batteria che dura davvero molto ed alcune features molto utili. Questo detto, pur avendo la testa grande, ho dovuto sostituire i cuscinetti dei padiglioni con alcuni più spessi per aumentare la presa e l'isolamento. Inoltre il software dedicato, sonar, presenta parecchie imperfezioni o bug che lo rendono utile la metà di quanto potrebbe essere. Per di più la qualità audio non è così alta, almeno a mio parere, non raggiunge minimamente i livelli tanto decantati in rete. Se paragonate alle mie epos h3 pro hybrid, che spesso si trovano nuove alla stessa cifra di queste nova 7, l'audio è povero e poco profondo.Rimangono comunque valide per quel che costano e godibili, tra le migliori nella fascia di prezzo.

    + Feels good with glasses on, doesn't make skin above ears itchy.+ Lightweight+ Adjustable+ Mic is well hidden well and doesn't irritate you with its presence when you don't need it+ Transparency mode that plays audio from your mic, I don't plan to use it outside, but good to have.+ Wired, Wireless 2.4G, Wireless Bluetooth - it's good to have all three options available- Sonar was one of the main selling points for me, but it's Windows only- Set of cables missing one very important cable - USB-A to USB-C adapter (while they added USB-C to USB-A), so if you have Macbook, or USB-C only ultrabook, don't expect to update your firmware easily.- Not very loud, you might find them a bit quiet for some conditions and on max volume you can hear white noiseAs for sound quality - it's average. Good and balanced sound on all frequencies out of the box. Maybe a bit richer bass than it should be, but it's definitely advantage for gaming.As for sound localization, the same problem as in other headphones -15° to +15° forward and backward sound the same or almost the same. Overall, they're good at producing footsteps.So, in terms of quality they're like €80 wired headphones and you pay extra on top for build quality, wirelessness, and other features. In terms of music/gaming performance you don't get anything extra.

    Fangen mit dem Aufbau an ,es macht einen stabilen Eindruck. Eine Menge Plastik aber stabil.KomfortDie Ohrpolster sind am Anfang etwas hart ,werden aber schnell weicher ,insgesamt komfortabel für lange sessions. Passive Isolation ist kaum vorhanden ,man hört seine Umgebung recht gut ,fast wie bei offenen Kopfhörern. Man bekommt nicht so schnell heiße Ohren (für mich sehr wichtig)Größenverstellung ist sehr gut ,es passen auch große Köpfe drunter,  im Gegensatz zu vielen anderen Marken.Ein Nachteil ist die Geräuschübertragung ,egal was man anfasst oder wenn der Kopf bewegt wird, man hört es.Der größte Minuspunkt sind die kleinen Ohrmuscheln ,sie sind in der Länge extrem kurz.Ich hab sie mit meinen sony 1000 xm2 verglichen ,sie sind einen ganzen Zentimeter länger als die steelseries . Ich mein damit den Innenraum der Ohrmuscheln, dadurch mussten die Ohrläppchen immer hochgeschoben werden damit der Kopfhörer überhaupt getragen werden kann.Was nach längeren Tragen zu Kopfweh geführt hat.Das war auch der Grund warum ich das Headset wieder zurückgeschickt habe. Ich kann das auch nicht nachvollziehen ,größenverstellbar sogar für große Köpfe und Ohrmuscheln für kleine Kinder.Akkulaufzeit ist gut wie angegeben, ca. 35 Std.KlangIst ganz ordentlich, Bässe und Höhen sind stark betont, also wie bei den meisten gaming Headsets.Der Bass könnte trockener, präziser sein aber die meisten werden zufrieden sein ,alles Geschmackssache.Höhen sind gut ,keine zischlaute ,sehr schön.Mitten ,die für die Sprache wichtig sind, sind zurückgenommen ,dadurch sind die Dialoge ziemlich leise.Mag ich gar nicht, da werde ich an Filme und Serien erinnert, bei denen man auch öfter fragt ""was haben die gesagt ? ""  Für Singelplayer nicht der Brüller.Das räumliche kommt wirklich gut rüber , Ortung der Gegner usw. Ist sehr gut, also für Multiplayer geeignet.Hoffe das die Info den einem oder anderen hilft

    These sound great and feel great, only downside is that your ears sometimes rest on the drivers, however no more so than any other steel series headset I have owned in the past. However the fabric they use on the ear cup more than makes up for it.

    Of all the goods I ordered online or few I have this headset is easily the most overrated frustrating stressful piece of crap I ever ordered...in my top 2.Before Day one I got it I did my research read reviews ....what the critics say .......but sometimes your own actual hands on experience matters more than what others say.Corsair may excel in life or keyboards but I question the competency of their audio department big time in BOTH functionality AND compatibility .First day i got it all functions worked ....ecen before i installed the drivers via the wireless usb. I look after all.my tech stuff I don't fiddle I use instructions rather than deviate risk wrecking perfectly working device .But when the driver itself generates a sinister ' seed ' in your pc system planting data of other audio drivers for different headset without me knowing until ...come day no.2 receiving the headset i discover mysteriously that my original driver was overridden...with icon and model of a lesser headset...so of course the headset did not respond to the wireless signal. On top of that after driver auto pilot problem courtesy f the stupid icue client ...coincidentally...the headset lights did not come on...and I suspected I had a faulty headset...that  happened to develop a fault in the functionality of the headset at same time the driver buggered up.There were no programs or updates from Windows that interfered .The notion I conclude is for it over inflated undeserved price tag the corsair void elite..and perhaps all their advanced wired headsets...by it name sake is nothing more than a empty a la k void of a hole that rips you off sucks your cash in its void centre ..leaving you with a useless piece of junk excuse for a headset  .Maybe I got a rare effective headset I don't care if others give it praise ...vut let be reminder to you all frankly that there no such thing as flawless technology...frankly whrn it comes to headsets corsair best stick with wired and abandon the wireless experiment it a sham and a lie that it compatible to window 7.The most overblown overrated headset I can think of ...all I got o it of it while it worked on day no.1 was 3 hrs of watching a movie...on top of that before the drivers auto switched to reflect a headset through the icue client u do NOT own...whrn initially correct drivers were installed...it was not compatible unresponsive to watching YouTube channel on the net ..non responsive to fifa soccer  waste of time and money if u have Windows 7 that they say it windows 7 on top of all their fraudulent claims at Corsair well I blame them for false claims about the performance and quality for misleading customers who own win 7. I arranged for refund ...I got new headset coming...this time lesser known brand but one uses science fact not fiction like corsair to explain it compatibility etc...it half the price too and usb connection I gladly take that over a failure of a wireless device

    Très bonne qualité par rapport aux prix d'autres modèles supérieure en gamme.Agréable à porter même avec des lunettes.Quand le micro est relevé il se mute automatiquement et c'est très pratique.La distance sans fil est moyenne (ça ne tient pas les 10m promi mais plutot 6/7m).L'autonomie est moyenne (je le recharg tous les 2/3 jours) mais il se recharge rapidement et on peu l'utiliser en le chargeant.Bref je recommande surtout que le prix est intéressant pour un modèle corsair sans fil avec tous ses avantages et très peu d'inconvénients.

    Zunächst einmal möchte ich anmerken, dass ich ein enorm fauler Rezensionenschreiber bin. Doch statt den üblichen ""passt schon"" und ""alles wie erwartet"" Rezis, möchte ich hier doch einmal etwas länger ausholen...Ich habe mich nach langem Überlegen, ob es ein reines Gaming-Headset, oder eine Art Kombilösung aus Gaming-Headset und Kopfhörer für Musik unterwegs werden soll, für das reine Gaming-Headset entschieden.Diese Entscheidung beruht auf der Tatsache, dass es die Notwendigkeit gab mir ganz zügig ein neues Set Earbuds zu bestellen, welche mir anschließend so gut gefallen haben, dass eine Kombilösung nicht mehr notwendig war. Also habe ich mich durch den unfassbaren Angebotsdschungel aus Gaming-Headsets gearbeitet und darauf auf folgende Kriterien geachtet:- Stoff an den Höhrmuscheln- 7.1 Sound- Namenhafter Hersteller- Tragekomfort- Gute Bewertungen- Preis max. € 150,00-- Solide Verarbeitung- KabellosWas soll ich groß sagen - Alle diese Eigenschaften bietet dieses Headset und überzeugt mich dabei auf ganzer Linie.Es war mir wichtig, dass man auch bei längeren Spielesessions ein angenehmes Tragegefühl hat und das vor allem keine nervige Schweißbildung, wie unter Kunstleder-Ohrmuscheln entsteht. Das Headset hat ein nicht zu unterschätzendes Gewicht, ist also kein ultra-leichtes Plastikdingsbums, sondern sitzt angenehm ""satt"" auf dem Kopf. Das ist aber auch genau das was ich wollte. Ein solide verarbeitetes Gerät, dass nicht nach 10x absetzen an irgendeiner Sollbruchstelle zerbricht.Der Sound ist für meine Ohren tatsächlich herausragend und läßt sich mittels kostenlos downloadbarer Software auch für Soundfetischisten haarklein anpassen. Es hat eine wirklich tiefe Basslast und kristallklare Höhen und überzeugt mich auch in den Mitteltönen vollständig. Ich habe auf YouTube viele Videos mit Sound-Demonstrationen für 7.1 Systeme angesehen und war begeistert.Die Übertragung mittels W-Lan Dongle reicht in unserer etwa 80m² Wohnung bis in jeden Raum und wird erst nach 2 Türen und drei Wänden auf dem Balkon brüchig, was für mich völlig in Ordnung geht!Der Akku hält mehrere Stunden zuverlässig und die akustische Warnung für geringe Restladung ist früh genug, als das man in aller Ruhe das Ladekabel anschließen kann und weiterspielen kann, wöhrend das Gerät lädt. Hier aber ganz wichtig zu wissen - es ist NICHT möglich das Headset nur mit Kabel und ohne den W-Lan-Dongle zu benutzen. Das Kabel ist tatsächlich nur zum Laden dabei.Wer RGB-Styles mag, der wird auch hier mit der Software und individuellen Einstellmöglichkeiten glücklich - ist nicht meins, aber es geht halt.Zu guter Letzt habe ich mich mit dem Preis beschäftigt, welcher mit knapp € 120,00 sicher kein Billigprodukt repräsentiert, aber eben auch längst nicht in der Top-Liga mitspielt. Aus genau diesem Grund ist das Headset noch interessanter für mich, weil es mit wirklich vielen, anderen Geräten aus weit teureren Bereichen mühelos mithalten kann. Ein guter Freund von mir nutzt ein Headset aus dem Preissegment über € 400,00 und ich kann nicht wirklich richtig viele Unterschiede feststellen.In der Hoffnung Euch eine Kaufentscheidung etwas erleichtert zu haben, wünsche ich viel Spaß mit dem Void!

    Le cuffie Corsair Bluetooth che ho acquistato qualche anno fa sono ancora sorprendentemente belle e performanti. La qualità del suono è cristallina e le cuffie sono in grado di distinguere perfettamente i suoni alti e bassi. Se sei un appassionato di musica, queste cuffie ti permetteranno di ascoltare la tua musica preferita ad un livello superiore, ma non solo! Anche guardare film sarà un'esperienza immersiva grazie alla qualità del suono che ti farà sentire come se fossi in mezzo all'azione. Inoltre, se sei un appassionato di gaming online, queste cuffie sono ottime per distinguere con facilità i passi degli avversari, dando un vantaggio competitivo sul campo di battaglia. Consiglio vivamente queste cuffie a chiunque cerchi un prodotto di alta qualità e performance.Pro⬆️:-Sono cuffie molto comode , con un giusto peso.-Non hanno la cancellazione del rumore ma le cuffie coprono così bene che sembra quasi che ci sia.-Sono eleganti e dal design moderno.-L'audio e il microfono hanno un buon suono solo in alcune app (discord) l'imput è basso e non si riesce ad alzarlo.-Buon raggio d'azione , copre circa la metà della mia casaContro⬇️:-A volte può richiedere un po' di tempo per ristabilire la connessione quando si accende, il che è fastidioso quando si ha bisogno di rispondere rapidamente a una chiamata-I padiglioni auricolari possono diventare caldi dopo un po', ma in gran parte ne vale la pena per quanto sono efficaci nell'isolare i suoni esterni.-La porta di ricarica sulle cuffie è piccola e difficile da localizzare.

    Spedizione: imballato con cura, rispettate le date di spedizione.Prodotto: ottimo prodotto, qualità prezzo eccellenti, materiale di costruzione plastica di buona qualità.Opinioni personali: il prodotto è ottimo sia cablato che non in quanto li posseggo entrambi, le utilizzo da più di un anno ogni giorno e non hanno grossi segni di usura, soprattutto la spugna che poggia alle orecchie è ancora come nuova. Per il loro prezzo l'audio è perfetto nessun calo di prestazioni. Le consiglio a chiunque sia per lavoro in quanto molto comode sia per gaming se si vuole un ottimo prodotto anche competitivo senza spendere cifre astronomiche.Può essere anche un ottima idea regalo.

    De titel van de review zegt eigenlijk alles. Op het eerste zicht lijkt de bouwkwaliteit beter dan verwacht, veel plastic maar de belangrijke componenten zijn in metaal uitgevoerd. Vrij zwaar aanvoelend product, wat zowel een voordeel als een nadeel kan zijn. Zit zéér comfortabel omdat het de volledige oorschelp omsluit en de randen van het oor dus niet schuren tegen de randen van de hoofdtelefoon. Wel wat warm indien lang gedragen. Audiokwaliteit is voldoende, zeker voor gamen, maar indien je deze hoofdtelefoon primair voor muziek koopt zou ik een ander product uitkiezen, al is ook daar de kwaliteit voldoende. Microfoon-kwaliteit ook voldoende met vrij goede ruisonderdrukking, volume standaard wat aan de lage kant maar dit kan omhoog gedraaid wordenVoor deze prijs zeker aan te raden, veel waar voor je geld vergeleken met anderen in dezelfde prijsklasse

    My old headphones suddenly died and as I game a lot - I had to buy new ones sooner rather than later. My issue is that majority of the headphones usually hurt my ears after wearing them for 1h + (not a glass wearer, just weird ear issues), so it was difficult for me to find ones that wouldn't do that.I went to my boyfriend and he let me tried his Corsair headphones for a few hours. I quickly knew - these are what I'm looking for. Found them here, cheaper than expected, and bought them. Got delivered very quickly. The build quality is good, they do not look like they going to fall apart after 2 months of use. The sound quality is very good, but I can't say if you can listen to classic music or hard rock in them with a A++ quality, as that's not what I use them for. They are quite heavy, but well balanced and comfy to wear. I like that the mic is attached, but if you tip it up it turns off, no need to press any buttons. I love the customisation. You can make your own light profiles: different light colours, different type of pulsing or switch the light off completely (which saves the battery). Battery life is good, I purchased the headphones about a week ago and didn't need to charge them yet.As summary: I was delighted to find something that doesn't hurt my ears, is very decent built quality, good sound quality, attached mic and no cable - all for a very good price! My boyfriend has got the same pair and been using it for about a year (more or less) and he's very happy with them too.

    Ho comprato questo prodotto per effettuare streaming online.A me non piace avere cuffie così grosse in testa, infatti il mio primo tentativo fu un paio di auricolari wireless ma con scarso successo. Dopo una ricerca abbastanza approfondita ho deciso per questo modello di cuffie per una manciata di motivi:- La marca- I cuscinetti in memory foam- Il tessuto in microfibra (invece che in pelle!)L'audio è spettacolare. Normalmente stereo, ma se collegato con l'usb con scheda audio 7.1 integrata si ha un effetto davvero incredibile. Il suo è perfetto anche ad alto volume. E' stracomoda. Non pesa sulla testa, i cuscinetti sono morbidissimi e anche col caldo, dopo diverse ore, la sudorazione è limitata.Il microfono non era una delle mie priorità, ma se lo è per voi allora questo prodotto non è adatto. L'audio registrato dal microfono è molto simile a quello di una semplice chiamata telefonica, ma molto limpido.

    Je recherchais mon premier casque Gaming. J'ai essayé le Fnatic Duel Gaming ... je l'ai retourné dès la première utilisation car le son était médiocre pour un casque à 150€. Comme j'avais tapis, clavier et souris Corsair je me suis dirigé vers leur catalogue, ce VOID m'a tapé dans l’œil !Les points positifs :+ DESIGN affirmé mais qui reste sobre. J'ai choisis la version SE car je trouve la couleur Jaune de chez Corsair sympathique et parce qu'il y a cette station de livrer avec, qui déporte le récepteur USB afin d'éviter des interférences.+ QUALITE de fabrication : J'avais peur d'avoir des bruits de plastiques de mauvaise qualité, mais au contraire la qualité de fabrication et d'assemblage est très bonne ! Les parties rotatives au dessus des oreillettes sont en aluminium qui sont du plus bel effet. Ce casque respire la qualité.+ LE SANS FIL et sa portée ! Qu'est-ce que c'est agréable de ne plus avoir à ce soucier du câble, de pouvoir se déplacer dans la pièce librement avec le casque pour continuer à discuter où à écouter de la musique. De base le récepteur et appairé au casque, c'est du Pug & Play, ce qui est top ! La portée est annoncée à 12m, c'est en effet le cas, du moment qu'il n'y a pas de murs porteurs sur le chemin. Je peux me balader presque partout dans ma maison sans décrochage. La portée de 12m est atteignable pour ma part même avec quelques cloisons, sur le même étage.+ LES SPEAKERS : Là où le Fnatic m'avait beaucoup déçu c'était sur la qualité audio (qui était donc très mauvaise). Là j'ai à faire à un bon casque, sans être excellent comme mon Sennheiser Momentum 2 (pas le même tarif mais pas le même usage non plus ^^), le VOID se débrouille bien, les différents préréglages de l'equalizer dans le Soft de Corsair ne sont pas mauvais. Certains diront que le VOID manque de basses, mais ça ne me dérange pas plus que ça, le préréglage Bass Boost comble en grande partie ce problème. En jeu sur CS:GO c'est un pur plaisir d'utiliser ce casque, il y a une bonne spatialisation une fois le mode Dolby d'activer, j'entends mieux les différents joueurs sur la Map et leur localisation. Vraiment, je suis satisfait de l'écoute que me procure ce VOID.+ LE MICRO : En lisant des reviews j'ai pu lire que le micro n'avait pas un fort volume. Personnellement mes compagnons de jeu ainsi que mes correspondants sur Skype m'entendent parfaitement et de manière clair. J'ai juste dû mettre un niveau d'activation de la voix pour ne pas qu'ils entendent ma respiration, mais en 2 secondes c'est régler. Le fait de lever le micro le désactive, ce qui est très pratique : pas besoin de chercher le bouton sur le casque (mais cela fait doublon pour une même fonction pour le coup.+ CONFORT : les matériaux utilisés et le fait qu'il ne sert pas la tête rendent ce casque plutôt léger et qui sait se faire oublier, malgré son poids importants (390g). J'ai été étonné pour le coup. Il peut donc se porter durant plusieurs heures sans risque d'avoir mal aux oreilles. Les porteurs de lunettes en seront également satisfait.Les points négatifs :- LE CLAMBING (maintient sur la tête) : le casque ne sert pas du tout la tête, je l'ai mis en point négatif car cela peut en être un pour certain. Pour moi ça ne me dérange pas, j'ai une tête assez grosse du coup il ne glisse pas, mais pour des plus petites têtes, un mouvement brusque et l'arceau est devant les yeux ;)- L'INDICATEUR du niveau de batterie : Il y a une Led sur le casque indiquant le niveau de batterie, mais placée sous l'oreillette donc invisible une fois sur la tête. Le seul autre moyen de le savoir et d'aller dans le CUE > Paramètres > VOID. Autant dire que ce n'est pas très intuitif. J'espère qu'il corrigeront cela à la prochaine MAJ du logiciel, pour que celui-ci soit visible sur la page d'accueil du CUE)- L'AUTONOMIE : elle est correcte, Pour ma part elle oscille entre 6h et 8h (sans RGB) avec un volume d'écoute élevé (50% CS GO, 20% GTA V, 30% Musique), mais le niveau de charge indiqué dans le logiciel de Corsair n'est pas précis, ce qui fait que je l'ajoute dans les points négatifs. Il m'est arrivé de voir le pourcentage de batterie bloqué à un certain pourcentage pendant 2h pour le voir après chuter. Une MAJ du Firmware peut sans doute corriger cette imprécision.

    I bought these gaming headphones last week at a reduced price of £79.00 which was 27% off after searching for a good pair for weeks. I asked all my gaming friends for recommendations and all of them listed different brands. I wanted wireless to say goodbye to the cord which kept getting wrapped around my chair with my old ones. 7.1 surround. A good quality microphone and speakers. A decent battery was also important as some of my gaming sessions on the weekend with friends can go on for hours. I got all of these things.WIRELESSThe headphones use 2.4GHz wireless frequency to connect to your PC witht he supplied adapter. It is essentially plug-and-play, with very little setup required (I discuss iCUE below). The range is great, I can go from all corners of my home and it never cuts out and I haven't noticed any latency with any game, video or song I listen to. I am still getting used to not being tethered to my desk with a cord anymore and realised today I can actually go and make a cup of tea while still talking to my friends now.BUILD QUALITYStrong plastic design with a lovely shape and adjustable headband. Combined with the comfortable ear rests which do a great job with external noise reduction, I happy with the quality of this product. I also love how the mic can be raised which mutes all input audio if for example you want to go to the bathroom but still want to listen to a video etc. The charging is fast (cable supplied) and has a great length in case you need it while working/gaming and the battery starts getting low. However, I've not needed to do this yet. The lights on the side are nice and funky and can be changed to suit your style.SOUND AND iCUEMusic, gaming and video sound quality ARE crisp, with a nice balance of bass. A massive upgrade to my old ELO headphones. The surround is amazing and I can hear the location of every footstep in my games. I have nothing bad to say about the sound quality, absolutley out of this world! I can also hear my friends a lot clearer in Discord calls. You can download the supported application iCUE which can change the colour od the lights on the side, change the levels of bass etc. You can pretty much customize the entire headphone experience via this software and I highly recommend downloading it. It also supports Nvidia Broadcast which only adds tot he overall sound and microphone quality.MICROPHONEWhen I joined a call the other day using these for the first time, my friends noticed a massive improvement to my voice quality. They background noise reduction works extremely well, and makes my voice very clear. I haven't tested this with games I own which use voice recognition yet but I am sure I won't have any problems with these either as after hearing my voice back, the feedback was faultless. Sounded like I was in a recording studio!OVERALLExcellent value for money, fantastic quality. I would highly recommend these to any gamer and people who work from home and need to take conference calls. 10/10

    Este es el segundo par que me compro, el último me ha durado desde 2019, unos 5 años aproximadamente. La batería apenas se ha resentido en todo este tiempo con un uso diario de muchas horas (aún que de todas maneras se pueden usar enchufados con su cable USB que es bastante largo).Son muy cómodos, cubren toda la oreja, aíslan decentemente, buena calidad de sonido (especialmente para videojuegos con el sonido envolvente), micrófono bastante bien, las almohadillas pueden ser reemplazadas fácilmente a un precio asequible (solo he tenidonque hacerlo una vez en 5 años).En definitiva, puede que no sean los mejores cascos del mercado en cuanto a calidad de sonido o micrófono, pero no tienen nada que envidiarle a los gama alta, ya que lo compensan con buena calidad, rendimiento y durabilidad!Ademas, tienen leds personalizables con la app de corsair (apagados el gasto de batería a penas se nota, y le da un toque al set up)Nota final 9.5/10

    good mic, and good sound quality. software is easy to set up and isn't terrible. the build quality is good and sturdy and won't break if you drop it once or twice. though i do wish it had a detachable cable, though it is just a personal preference, and it is comfortable.

    Ero indeciso se acquistarle o meno. Alla fine l'ho fatto e devo dire che sono rimasto molto soddisfatto. La qualità è ottimo, il prodotto arriva imballato perfettamente.La qualità del suono e del microfono sono ottime. Il suono forse non è altissimo, però è alto, e detto francamente devo tenere il volume del pc Windows a 40 quanto vedo una siete tv, quindi penso che sia ottimo, almeno per me.Il design è accattivante, io le ho prese bianche e nere e sono rimasto soddisfatto, il cavo è lungo e soddisfa ogni aspettativa. Beh che dire è corsair ed è un ottimo prodotto. Il colore lo si può impostare tramite pc.L'unica attenzione è che sono cuffie grandi, quindi potrebbe non andare bene a chi ha una testa piccola, a me per fortuna vanno alla perfezione, con un piccolo svantaggio forse. Del resto sono ottime

    before we go into the my review i need to point out I've owned numerous headsets from logi, HyprX, turtle beach over the years, so far i owned 3 Logitech (all broke), 1 Hyper-X (not ergonomic for me), 3 Turtle beach (wire gave up), but so far this is the best flipping headset I've seen, felt, and wore in a long time.firstly the built quality is absolutely amazing, from the moment i pulled it out the box, and put it on my head although the weight at first was quiet a bit off putting but I've wore this headset for about 6 hours in a row so far with limited breaks (mainly toilet and water breaks) and i have not taken the weight into account at all, i believe that it is extremely well distributed around the headset AND FOR ONCE i don't have to amputate my leg just to hide the pain i get from taking off the headset as others in the past were just so uncomfortable to wear so when you'd take it off it would leave behind an excruciating pain but this one HELL NO it is perfectly built.The sound quality honestly blew me away... the base, the voice clarity and also how versatile this headset is while using the iCUE settings. Versatility is a BIG yes on this one. I can play my games like, R6S, Hell Let Loose, Post Scriptum, BF 1, Stellaris, MOWAS2, SW BF 2, PUBG, cheeki bit of fortnite, League of legends etc... it is also amazing to listen to music in it.i will be updating this review within the next 3-4 weeks and so on and on for you people.  <<<<Update 1>>>>Alright it may have been more than about 4 weeks however i promised updates on this for you guys.<< Durability and versatility>>So far the headset hasn't shown any sign of breaking yet however i do use extreme precaution when using it as all 3 of my past headsets for pc broke in similar ways having the support for the speakers completely disintegrated within the first 4 weeks (Logitech). This one however is still strong and still feels like it is brand new, no damage, no sound bug, no weird buzzing sound or echos in the background. The ear cushion is probably one of the best that I've ever seen and used, i never had my ears burning up with them specially recently with the heat wave we just had... heat was never an issue. it is also very adjustable and i have a big head and even still i don't need to extend the size by that much and it is still great.<<Performance>>This headset is basically what you need for games, music, movies, video and music editing etc... the bass is not really ear or brain shaking by itself nor with the ICUE software which honestly is not a problem and most people just wouldn't care to be honest as the sound is already godlike as it is, but for me i just like bassy songs so i just downloaded a bass amplifier and i was all sorted.<<weight>>honestly it feels heavy but it isn't heavy if that makes sense? I think it is mostly due to how well it grips on your head which make it feel like that but overall i can have this headset on for like 10 hours with minor breaks in between and it still doesn't bother me. weight distribution is also on point!<<issues>>The only issue i have with it is the wire, it tangles after a while and it is hard to get it back to normal as some curves and knots remains, however it isn't that annoying and doesn't really affect the performance or quality but never the less it is there.Overall still an amazing headset.

    I've had these for 24 hours after returning the hyper x cloud stinger s 7.1 headset I had bought. Initially I was worried the 7.1 surround sound would have the same issues as the hyper x and that they wouldn't be comfortable as many have said but after having them recommend by friends who have the pro version undecided to take the plunge and boy am I grateful that I did . They are nice and comfortable not to loose ( I do have a big head ) the sound is amazing the voices from my friends while talking on discord is nice and clear with the mic picking up my voice nice and clear too . The noise cancelling is top notch as I vape and non of my friends could hear when I did vape it also cut out my music from my phone which I purposely turned the volume up to max and held the phone to the mic with no noise coming through only while I spoke . Volume control is super easy  switching from different sound settings is as easy as pressing the volume control on the left ear cup and switching from 7.1 to stereo is just press and hold the switch . You get a decent length of cable with a usb connection . Would I recommend these to people hell yeah I would and I'd buy them again if this set ever broke

    Ich habe mir das Corsair Void Elite RGB Wireless Gaming Headset für meine Playstation 5 gekauft und bin nach zwei Jahren intensiver Nutzung immer noch absolut begeistert von seiner Leistung. Dieses Headset ist ein absolutes Muss für jeden, der ein immersives Gaming-Erlebnis sucht, insbesondere bei Shootern.Der 7.1 Surround Sound des Headsets ist beeindruckend. Ich konnte jedes Detail in meinen Lieblingsshootern hören, sei es das leise Schleichen meiner Gegner oder die Explosionen in der Ferne. Der Klang ist klar und präzise, was mir einen klaren Vorteil im Spiel verschafft.Die kabellose Verbindung des Headsets ist zuverlässig und bietet eine Reichweite von bis zu 12 Metern. Ich konnte mich frei bewegen, ohne mich um Kabel oder Einschränkungen kümmern zu müssen. Die ultraschnelle Latenz sorgt dafür, dass der Ton synchron mit dem Gameplay bleibt und ein reibungsloses Spielerlebnis gewährleistet wird.Die Akkulaufzeit des Headsets hat zwar nach zwei Jahren etwas nachgelassen, ist aber immer noch voll ausreichend. Ich kann immer noch einen Ganzen Tag am Stück spielen, bevor ich es wieder aufladen muss. Das Aufladen selbst geht schnell und unkompliziert.Das Design des Headsets ist modern und ansprechend. Die RGB-Beleuchtung verleiht ihm einen coolen Look und lässt sich individuell anpassen. Der Tragekomfort ist ebenfalls hervorragend, auch bei längeren Gaming-Sessions.Insgesamt bin ich mit dem Corsair Void Elite RGB Wireless Gaming Headset äußerst zufrieden und kann es jedem Gamer empfehlen, der ein hochwertiges und immersives Audioerlebnis sucht. Der Surround Sound, die kabellose Verbindung und der Tragekomfort machen dieses Headset zu einem unverzichtbaren Zubehör für Shooter auf der Playstation 5. Trotz nachlassender Akkulaufzeit nach zwei Jahren immer noch 5 Sterne!

    Op zich ben ik redelijk te spreken over deze headset wat betreft geluidskwaliteit van de speakers en de microfoon.Waar ik iets minder over te spreken ben is de bouwkealiteit. Dit is ondertussen mijn tweede exemplaar. Eerste headset ging de mute knop van kapot binnen 3 maanden (Knop bleef hangen en stuurde meerdere inputs). Bij de tweede begint nu binnen nog geen jaar de power knop al wat te blijven hangen. Het flip to mute systeem van de microfoon is onbetrouwbaar. De ene keer werkt het prima, maar op andere momenten moet je de microfoon een tweede keer ""flippen"" voordat hij werkt. Het rode ""mute"" ledje gaat telkens wel uit, maar de mic geeft geen geluid door.Accu gaat ook wat korter mee dan verwacht en je moet de icue software blijven gebruiken om de leds op de oorschelpen uit te kunnen zetten. Dit kan dus niet via een knop en wordt ook niet opgeslagen.Ander minpuntje is micro usb voor het laden. Dat gaat minder lang mee vergeleken met usb c stekkers.

    Dopo aver avuto una brutta esperienza durata fin troppo con le precedenti cuffie da me acquistate, ho acquistato queste Corsair Void Pro in edizione speciale di colore giallo, in occasione di un'offerta lampo di Amazon.Ordinate ed arrivate nella stessa giornata ( Fantastico servizio Prime di Amazon ), queste cuffie, si trovano all'interno di una confezione sgargiante che mostra l'articolo acquistato e le sue caratteristiche.Al suo interno, una volta aperta la confezione, troviamo le cuffie avvolte da svariate pellicole di protezione e bloccate con un paio di lacci metallici plastificati.Al di sotto delle cuffie, troviamo la dotazione di questo modello che comprende :1) Un pratico manuale d'uso purtroppo non in lingua italiana ma in ogni caso abbastanza semplice per chi ha un minimo di conoscenza di base di inglese od in alternativa di : Francese, Tedesco, Spagnolo, Portoghese o Russo.Si, in effetti, l'italiano non sarebbe stato male vista la quantita' di lingue supportate.2) Un cavo USB > Micro Usb per ricaricare le cuffie.3) Una basetta con fondo gommato con prolunga USB per collegare la chiave WiFi al Pc in modo da posizionarla comodamente dove si vuole.4) Spugnetta antivento copri microfono.I cavi, presentano un buon design dei connettori anche se avrei preferito, al giorno d'oggi, vedere dei cavi con rivestimento in corda presenti anche su cuffie di fascia molto bassa.Passiamo alle cuffie che si presentano con un design futuristico ed un peso accettabile di circa 385 grammi.Una volta indossate, si puo' notare che non fanno molta presa sulla testa rimanendo poco serrate ed io mi sono sempre considerato uno dalla testa grande.Questo puo' essere considerato sia un pregio che un difetto.I pregio puo' essere il confort dopo lunghe sessioni di utilizzo, il difetto puo' essere quello dell'isolamento dai rumori esterni.I gamers, sono esigenti, vogliono tutto e non sono soddisfatti di nulla ma, anche ritrovandomi in questa categoria, con il tempo sono diventato piu' pragmatico e quindi sono per dire che non si puo' avere tutto ma l'importante e' avere un oggetto che esegua bene le sue funzioni principali.Nel caso di queste cuffie, per quanto mi riguarda, le funzioni principali sono :1) Qualita' dell'audio in entrata ed in uscita.2) Qualita' del WiFi.3) Durata della batteria.Dopo aver dato uno sguardo al manuale ed aver scaricato dal sito di Corsair il software di gestione, mi sono apprestato ad inserire la chiavetta WiFi sopra la sua basetta ed i drivers delle cuffie si sono installati automaticamente.Ovviamente, i drivers permettono di far funzionare le cuffie ma se vogliamo avere il totale controllo sul ns. nuovo acquisto, dovremo installare l'iCUE di Corsair che ci dara' accesso : ai settaggi per il 7.1, ad un equalizzatore, al controllo e gestione dell'illuminazione ed ad altre features dedicate alle Void Pro.Inserita la chiavetta, vengono installati rapidamente i drivers di gestione e le cuffie sono pronte all'uso.Anche senza iCUE il suono e' qualitativamente buono e potente.Installato iCUE...la storia cambia e quello che sembrava buono, diventa ottimo.iCUE, si presenta finalmente in italiano e con un'interfaccia semplice ma curata e dall'uso intuitivo.Essendo un software che permette di controllare piu' dispositivi, ha una schermata Home dove potremo scegliere il dispositivo da gestire.Cliccando sull'icona delle nostre Void Pro Wireless, entreremo nella pagina delle impostazione delle suddette potendo gestire gli innumerevoli effetti di illuminazione che vanno dal semplice lampeggio di un singolo colore alla modalita' arcobaleno.Il logo di Corsair presente su entrambi i padiglioni delle Void Pro si illuminera' in base alla nostra scelta.Ma potremo anche scegliere di non utilizzare l'illuminazione risparmiando alla batteria del lavoro extra e guadagnando una durata maggiore di utilizzo prima di dover ricaricare.Passando alle impostazioni dell'audio, troviamo 5 preset forniti dalla casa che vanno dalla valorizzazione dei bassi all'ottimizzazione per i film ma potremo creare altri profili a piacimento in modo da personalizzare la nostra esperienza con queste cuffie andando ad agire su un equalizzatore a 10 bande.Oltre a tutto cio', potremo scegliere se utilizzare la modalita' Stereo o Surround.All'attivazione delle suddette modalita' una voce ( Donna sexy ^_^ ) ci avvertira' del cambio di impostazione.Questo, avviene anche quando ruoteremo l'asta del microfono in posizione di utilizzo.La nostra amica, ci avvertira' dicendoci quando il microfono e' attivo o non attivo.Ho provato queste cuffie con un player audio con qualche mp3, ho visto spezzoni di film con un player video e le ho provate in game con un paio di titoli.Suonano bene, l'audio e' di buona qualita' ed il surround e' veramente piacevole laddove sia possibile sfruttarlo.Provate con un programma di chat vocale, risultano buone anche come qualita' della voce.Termino questa recensione parlando brevemente del WiFi.Ho avuto precedenti esperienze con cuffie da gaming WiFi ed ho patito non poco con i software di gestione.Con queste ho girato per tutta casa senza notare disconnessioni di alcun genere.Pro- Buona qualita' audio in entrata ed uscita.- Sono 7.1- Software di gestione completo ed intuitivo.- Un WiFi finalmente valido.- Isolamento discreto nonostante non siano serrate sulla testa.- Dotazione.Contro- Troppo poco serrate sulla testa.- Cavetteria non cordata.Come per altri articoli, mi riservo eventualmente di aggiornare tra un po' di tempo questa recensione anche per valutare la durata della batteria che ovviamente al momento non ho idea di quanto possa realmente durare.Al di la di questo, consiglio senza ombra di dubbio l'acquisto di questo articolo a chi cerca un prodotto con queste caratteristiche.

    Seit einigen Jahren schon bringt Corsair gute Komponenten auf den Markt.Auch die Corsair Void RGB Wireless und dessen Nachfolger, das Void Elite RGB Wireless.Diese Serie bietet einen sehr guten Tragekomfort wie ein sehr angenehmer Kopfbügel mit weicher Polsterung und gut ausgelegte, abnehmbare stoffüberzogene Ohrpolster.Der Sound ist bereits in den Standardeinstellungen sehr gut, kann jedoch über die Software (aktuell iCUE) an eigene Bedürfnisse angepasst werden.Auch die Gelenke und Verbindungen sind sehr stabil ausgelegt.Das Headset kann gleichermaßen komplett wireless oder mit angeschlossenen USB-Kabel genutzt werden.Nun zu den kleinen Schwächen (hier sollte Corsair noch dran arbeiten, dann wäre es perfekt):- die Akkulaufzeit ist auch bei abgeschalteter Beleuchtung und Stereo-Betrieb etwas kurz (wenn es gut läuft zwischen 6 und 12 Stunden, eher 6, dann ist Schluss). Zum Glück kann das Headset auch mit Kabel betrieben werden.- Der Anschluss für das USB-Kabel liegt etwas ungünstig (lehnt man sich nach links wenn man das Headset wegen leeren Akkus mal mit Kabel nutzen muss, drückt man unweigerlich gegen den Anschluss, was bei zu viel Druck zur Beschädigung des einzigen Ladeports führen kann).- Die Reichweite hängt stark davon ab, wo man den Dongle platziert (an einem USB-Port am PC hinten oder bei einem Monitor mit eher mittig dahinter liegenden Anschlüssen kann sehr störend wirken), ein kleiner Stand zur freien Platzierung des USB-Sticks mit USB-Kabel als beiliegendes Zubehör hätte bei dem Preis bereits dabei sein können.- Das Microfon nimmt einen relativ leise auf und (da per USB/Dongle verbunden) bietet es keine Microfon Boost Option. Also entweder ein stärkeres Microfon oder eine in die Software integrierte Boost-Möglichkeit bzw. die Option zum Pegel noch höher regeln könnte hier Abhilfe schaffen.Trotz der kleinen Schwächen ein zu empfehlendes Headset, ich liebe die Klangqualität und den Tragekomfort

    Dopo svariati anni di gaming, il precedente headset era arrivato alla sua fine. Ho deciso di riprendere lo stesso identico modello, in quanto mi sono trovato perfettamente. Cuffie comode, non eccessivamente pesanti, microfono buono e facilità di mutarlo semplicemente tirandolo su. Buona ergonomia ed in estate non ti scaldano eccesivamente con i padiglioni. La batteria dei miei due modelli sempre perfetta (anche dopo anni) e con ottima durata, quelle di un amico (prese usate come nuove) invece arrivate con un difetto, che le portava a scaricarsi repentinamente.Consigliatissime in ogni caso

    Premetto che ho acquistato queste cuffie in sconto per 65 euro. Constatato questo posso dire che per il prezzo pagato da me sono più che soddisfatto del mio acquisto. Alti davvero buoni, medi altrettanto se proprio dovessi dirgli qualcosa magari è sui bassi che pur non essendo male non sono troppo corposi. Suono pulito e microfono meglio della media. Soddisfatto per il mio acquisto e se comprate per un prezzo tra i 60 e gli 80 ne uscirete soddisfatto per l'acquisto.

    Corsair a name you associate well with gaming.Build: This headset is built to last. Plastic mold with metal swivel earcups and metal in the headband.Sound: The sound quality is insanely good. I hear everything clearly when playing all my favourite games. I also listen to music alot and these are also good for that. I would recommend downloading the software for some other options. The quality of the mic is is fantastic and it is Discord certified. No distortion or crackling.All the buttons are easy to access on the headset. Your mic mutes when when you lift it up and unites when pulled down.The headset is super comfy and feels so light when on the head. I game for hours at a time and it still feels as comfy. My ears sweat on my old headset but not on this.This headset is noted as being able to do PC and Console but you don't get the adaptor to do Console, that has to be bought separately (can be purchased on a ebay super cheap).I really love this headset and for £69.99 it was a steal.

    I have been using this for over 6 months now and it has proved to be a really good purchase.Sound quality : Really good, I use the headphones a lot to listen to music and I've never heard any distortion, the low and high frequencies are apparent, I can't moan reallyComfort : I need to wear glasses so large headphones can cause me discomfort in a short time, however I can wear these headphones for hours while wearing my glasses without fear for them being damaged, Perfect! If I had a niggle it would be that if I rock back in my chair the headphones can move, due to the weight I think, but i guess that is the price for having long life batteries in themMicrophone :  Difficult to comment here as I haven't really used them in anger, what I have noticed though is that the quality largely depends on the applications you use, e.g. using Discord gives you good consistent quality, Battle net will turn you into a Darlek if you raise your voice.Battery Life : Good, Batteries last a long time (5 hours I think) but not  as long as the box says they will.  The other thing is that it takes an age to fully charge them, and recommends that once charged the cable should be disconnected promptly afterwards (probably to preserve the overall life of the battery).  However the charge indicator light is effectively underneath the headphones if you use the stand which makes it awkward to check and to be realistic you are likely to charge them over night which could mean overcharging them for several hours if you're like me.  Make sure you have a USB-3 charger/hub to charge these with as it will dramatically reduce the charge time.  Trust me, a standard USB charger will take 24+ hours to charge them up.  I nearly sent them back when I first got them because it took 3 days to initially top them up.  However, on the plus side, you can use them while they are charging and the cable is unobtrusive and longNiggles : Because the headphones are bluetooth, you have to go through the Windows system settings to change the default audio output device.  This is really annoying and on older OS's has a tenancy to be either buried or inaccessible.  It would be really useful if Corsair built a menu option in there quick access app to allow changing of the default Audio output, otherwise download ""Audio Switch"" which isn't perfect but helps a lotPros:* Great sound quality* Great comfort (even with glasses)* Great battery life* Microphone is convenient, (quality depends on software used)Cons:* Battery charging time, Invest in a USB-3 charger/hub (seriously)* Can slide of your head if you tilt your head* Switching between speakers and headphone use though windows

    I bought a SteelSeries headset for Zoom and Teams on the advice of my Gamer son. I liked it and the wireless system works well - even though it uses USB-C and I had to buy an adapter.What’s that got to do with the Corsair? Well, when lockdown 3 started and schools went online, my 12 year old daughter needed a headset, so I gave her that SS set.This meant that I was back on a search for another set - and I thought ‘do I buy another SS set or buy what my son uses - a Corsair Gaming set?’ I researched, read up and looked around and came to the same conclusion that my son had - that these are very good value for money.For music I only use Bose as they suit my music choices, fit very well and sound superb. Yes they’re expensive but they are, for me, the best.When reading about these Corsairs, I saw posts that the fit isn’t great and the sound is not always what is expected. Now my online headphone requirements are modest; I’m no gamer but I am a songwriter and collaborate with my music partner regularly.These fit me nicely, the sound is great and I love the Mic which when you flip it up, turns the mic off. The American voice that states ‘Mic on / Mic off’ is annoying and perhaps you can turn it off - the software ‘iCue’ is easy to use and can control a host of other Corsair gadgets.My main gripe is the size of the USB Dongle - it’s the same size as an old thumb drive and could be damaged fairly easily. Unlike the SS version which is a lot smaller (but I accept that brings other issues).For the price I paid; this set is comfortable, very configurable (the lights on the sides of the headphone cup can be altered to your own taste like a lot of Corsair products), the mic flips up out of the way (and is turned off when in that position) and the overall sound of the set is very pleasing.You can adjust the sound to a variety of settings and although I’ve not played with that much, it does make a noticeable difference if you like that sort of thing and could enhance games.I’m very pleased with them and would recommend them.

    音や使い心地は特に問題なく、むしろ快適です。ゲームでの使用感も良好でマイクもメンバーから特に文句を言われません。問題は充電ケーブル(付属)を刺しているにもかかわらず首を動かしただけで充電が止まったりすることと、左側のマイクや充電ケーブル接続端子(USB2.0 micro-B)がある方から「カタカタ」と、中で何かがガタついているような音が聞こえる点です。右側も変な音が鳴っていましたが、原因がパッドと本体の間に黒いネジが一本挟まって居たといういたって簡単なことだったので取り出してからは特に問題はありません。はずれを引いたのかもしれませんが、ほかの方もご注意ください。

    Valgono quello che costano, sono riuscito a prenderle a 90 euro invece che 110 e posso dire con estrema facilità che sono le migliori che abbia mai provato.Comodità davvero elevata, quasi te le scordi addosso, spesso mi capita di andare in giro per casa con le cuffie senza rendermene conto, ovviamente regolabili a seconda della vostra dimensione, con cuscinetti in tessuto traspirante, perfette per l'estate.Per quanto riguarda la batteria, non sono sicuro siano 16 ore di autonomia, forse qualcosa in più addirittura.Per adesso mi sono trovato molto bene, l'audio è veramente molto buono, pecca un po' sulla nitidezza della voce, ma per il resto davvero una bomba.Microfono ok, funziona correttamente, può essere spento da un pulsante direttamente sulla cuffia sx oppure con la funzione ""Flip to mute"" ed in più il microfono si illumina di rosso per farti capire che è spento.se volete delle cuffie che valgano tutti i soldi spesi, vi consiglio queste.

    Scrivo questa recensione dopo oltre un mese di utilizzo. Ottime cuffie con padiglioni larghi che risultano molto comode e non troppo pesanti. L'arco che poggia sulla testa è rivestito di un tessuto imbottito e morbido che da una bella sensazione. Il microfono funziona perfettamente, non provocando rumori e fruscii (chiesto a più persone in conferenza). Dotate di un controllo del volume con levetta sul padiglione sinistro, che funge anche da bottone per attivare/disattivare il 5.1 (la differenza si sente anche se non è estrema).Possibilità di personalizzare i led sui padiglioni sia con colori che con movimenti diversi degli stessi, grazie al programma scaricabile dal sito del produttore, insieme a qualche altra opzione come per esempio l'inibizione dei rumori e suoni provenienti lateralmente al microfono.Inizialmente ho avuto dei problemi, poi risolti agevolmente: quando le cuffie erano attaccate sul retro del case a volte windows non eseguiva il boot, basta comunque non collegarle alle prime usb in alto della scheda madre o comunque disabilitando l'usb legacy dal bios.In sostanza ottime cuffie, suono chiaro e bella anche la confezione (in essa è presente anche una spugnetta per ricoprire il microfono). Ovviamente arrivate in men che non si dica grazie ad Amazon.

    Cuffie per pc e console, le cuffie hanno un bel design e sono comode anche se non isolano dai rumori e non riesci ad immergerti nel gioco..I controlli sui padiglioni sono comodissimi infatti dopo poche ore di utilizzo già si trova la posizione dei tasti facilmente.. nella scatola possiamo trovare cuffie, cavo jack da 3,5 e la scheda audio per collegare le cuffie al pc. Qualità dell’audio molto buona su pc con il 7.1 virtuale tramite il programma di corsair, ovviamente su console il 7.1 non funziona, però comunque anche su console la qualità dell’audio audio è buona, sentirete facilmente i passi dei nemici negli fps per esempio.Il microfono funziona molto bene, uso spesso la chat vocale con amici e mi sentono molto bene mai avuto problemi.. unica pecca è la qualità costruttiva che non è delle migliori..Comunque cuffie consigliate per chi usa sia pc che console e vuole avere solo un paio di cuffie che funzioni bene in entrambe le piattaforme..

    The audio quality is good, easy to set different profiles with iCue on your computer, but there are two major defects: battery duration, and the headset feels heavy.I end up charging the headset every very few days of use, and the cable provided with the headset itself wasn't working properly either, so I had to buy a new one myself.Also, the headset feels heavy on the head after a few hours, hurting a little bit.Overall, 4 stars, bought it on sale, I would have rather bought wired headset at this point, maybe, but it's still quiet okay.

    Cuffie molto belle e dalla costruzione particolarmente solida. Software di gestione completo, che permette di rilanciare la propria voce in cuffia, funzione molto comoda perché l'isolamento con l'esterno è estremo e risentire la propria voce è altresì gradevole. Molto belli i materiali, un po' caldo il materiale spugnoso delle cuffie che è rivestito di tessuto ma calza perfettamente all'esterno dei padiglioni auricolari. Ottimo il volume, che risulta già molto alto all'80% della regolazione. Il microfono ritorna una voce con frequenze molto fedeli e incorpora l'automatismo di auto spegnimento alla rotazione dell'archetto verso l'alto. In sostanza un ottimo ottimo prodotto, leggermente caro visti i prodotti della concorrenza.

    Bought this around a week ago now. It's an excellent headset.This is the 2017 version with the upgraded mic.The headset itself is made from a high quality plastic and metal frame, around the ears and head band there is a perforated foam which s extremely comfortable.Located on the left ear cup is also a mute button for the mic.Sound quality is very good for the headset although it does lack some low end bass during scenes with explosions, in the detailed sections of audio is where the headset really stands out, YouCan here with pin point accuracy where an enemy is located.Overall I'm very pleased with the headset and would definitely recommend.If you appreciated this review then please click the helpful button, it allows us to keep reviewing products like this for you.

    Of all the goods I ordered online or few I have this headset is easily the most overrated frustrating stressful piece of crap I ever ordered...in my top 2.Before Day one I got it I did my research read reviews ....what the critics say .......but sometimes your own actual hands on experience matters more than what others say.Corsair may excel in life or keyboards but I question the competency of their audio department big time in BOTH functionality AND compatibility .First day i got it all functions worked ....ecen before i installed the drivers via the wireless usb. I look after all.my tech stuff I don't fiddle I use instructions rather than deviate risk wrecking perfectly working device .But when the driver itself generates a sinister ' seed ' in your pc system planting data of other audio drivers for different headset without me knowing until ...come day no.2 receiving the headset i discover mysteriously that my original driver was overridden...with icon and model of a lesser headset...so of course the headset did not respond to the wireless signal. On top of that after driver auto pilot problem courtesy f the stupid icue client ...coincidentally...the headset lights did not come on...and I suspected I had a faulty headset...that  happened to develop a fault in the functionality of the headset at same time the driver buggered up.There were no programs or updates from Windows that interfered .The notion I conclude is for it over inflated undeserved price tag the corsair void elite..and perhaps all their advanced wired headsets...by it name sake is nothing more than a empty a la k void of a hole that rips you off sucks your cash in its void centre ..leaving you with a useless piece of junk excuse for a headset  .Maybe I got a rare effective headset I don't care if others give it praise ...vut let be reminder to you all frankly that there no such thing as flawless technology...frankly whrn it comes to headsets corsair best stick with wired and abandon the wireless experiment it a sham and a lie that it compatible to window 7.The most overblown overrated headset I can think of ...all I got o it of it while it worked on day no.1 was 3 hrs of watching a movie...on top of that before the drivers auto switched to reflect a headset through the icue client u do NOT own...whrn initially correct drivers were installed...it was not compatible unresponsive to watching YouTube channel on the net ..non responsive to fifa soccer  waste of time and money if u have Windows 7 that they say it windows 7 on top of all their fraudulent claims at Corsair well I blame them for false claims about the performance and quality for misleading customers who own win 7. I arranged for refund ...I got new headset coming...this time lesser known brand but one uses science fact not fiction like corsair to explain it compatibility etc...it half the price too and usb connection I gladly take that over a failure of a wireless device

    Très bonne qualité par rapport aux prix d'autres modèles supérieure en gamme.Agréable à porter même avec des lunettes.Quand le micro est relevé il se mute automatiquement et c'est très pratique.La distance sans fil est moyenne (ça ne tient pas les 10m promi mais plutot 6/7m).L'autonomie est moyenne (je le recharg tous les 2/3 jours) mais il se recharge rapidement et on peu l'utiliser en le chargeant.Bref je recommande surtout que le prix est intéressant pour un modèle corsair sans fil avec tous ses avantages et très peu d'inconvénients.

    Zunächst einmal möchte ich anmerken, dass ich ein enorm fauler Rezensionenschreiber bin. Doch statt den üblichen ""passt schon"" und ""alles wie erwartet"" Rezis, möchte ich hier doch einmal etwas länger ausholen...Ich habe mich nach langem Überlegen, ob es ein reines Gaming-Headset, oder eine Art Kombilösung aus Gaming-Headset und Kopfhörer für Musik unterwegs werden soll, für das reine Gaming-Headset entschieden.Diese Entscheidung beruht auf der Tatsache, dass es die Notwendigkeit gab mir ganz zügig ein neues Set Earbuds zu bestellen, welche mir anschließend so gut gefallen haben, dass eine Kombilösung nicht mehr notwendig war. Also habe ich mich durch den unfassbaren Angebotsdschungel aus Gaming-Headsets gearbeitet und darauf auf folgende Kriterien geachtet:- Stoff an den Höhrmuscheln- 7.1 Sound- Namenhafter Hersteller- Tragekomfort- Gute Bewertungen- Preis max. € 150,00-- Solide Verarbeitung- KabellosWas soll ich groß sagen - Alle diese Eigenschaften bietet dieses Headset und überzeugt mich dabei auf ganzer Linie.Es war mir wichtig, dass man auch bei längeren Spielesessions ein angenehmes Tragegefühl hat und das vor allem keine nervige Schweißbildung, wie unter Kunstleder-Ohrmuscheln entsteht. Das Headset hat ein nicht zu unterschätzendes Gewicht, ist also kein ultra-leichtes Plastikdingsbums, sondern sitzt angenehm ""satt"" auf dem Kopf. Das ist aber auch genau das was ich wollte. Ein solide verarbeitetes Gerät, dass nicht nach 10x absetzen an irgendeiner Sollbruchstelle zerbricht.Der Sound ist für meine Ohren tatsächlich herausragend und läßt sich mittels kostenlos downloadbarer Software auch für Soundfetischisten haarklein anpassen. Es hat eine wirklich tiefe Basslast und kristallklare Höhen und überzeugt mich auch in den Mitteltönen vollständig. Ich habe auf YouTube viele Videos mit Sound-Demonstrationen für 7.1 Systeme angesehen und war begeistert.Die Übertragung mittels W-Lan Dongle reicht in unserer etwa 80m² Wohnung bis in jeden Raum und wird erst nach 2 Türen und drei Wänden auf dem Balkon brüchig, was für mich völlig in Ordnung geht!Der Akku hält mehrere Stunden zuverlässig und die akustische Warnung für geringe Restladung ist früh genug, als das man in aller Ruhe das Ladekabel anschließen kann und weiterspielen kann, wöhrend das Gerät lädt. Hier aber ganz wichtig zu wissen - es ist NICHT möglich das Headset nur mit Kabel und ohne den W-Lan-Dongle zu benutzen. Das Kabel ist tatsächlich nur zum Laden dabei.Wer RGB-Styles mag, der wird auch hier mit der Software und individuellen Einstellmöglichkeiten glücklich - ist nicht meins, aber es geht halt.Zu guter Letzt habe ich mich mit dem Preis beschäftigt, welcher mit knapp € 120,00 sicher kein Billigprodukt repräsentiert, aber eben auch längst nicht in der Top-Liga mitspielt. Aus genau diesem Grund ist das Headset noch interessanter für mich, weil es mit wirklich vielen, anderen Geräten aus weit teureren Bereichen mühelos mithalten kann. Ein guter Freund von mir nutzt ein Headset aus dem Preissegment über € 400,00 und ich kann nicht wirklich richtig viele Unterschiede feststellen.In der Hoffnung Euch eine Kaufentscheidung etwas erleichtert zu haben, wünsche ich viel Spaß mit dem Void!

    Le cuffie Corsair Bluetooth che ho acquistato qualche anno fa sono ancora sorprendentemente belle e performanti. La qualità del suono è cristallina e le cuffie sono in grado di distinguere perfettamente i suoni alti e bassi. Se sei un appassionato di musica, queste cuffie ti permetteranno di ascoltare la tua musica preferita ad un livello superiore, ma non solo! Anche guardare film sarà un'esperienza immersiva grazie alla qualità del suono che ti farà sentire come se fossi in mezzo all'azione. Inoltre, se sei un appassionato di gaming online, queste cuffie sono ottime per distinguere con facilità i passi degli avversari, dando un vantaggio competitivo sul campo di battaglia. Consiglio vivamente queste cuffie a chiunque cerchi un prodotto di alta qualità e performance.Pro⬆️:-Sono cuffie molto comode , con un giusto peso.-Non hanno la cancellazione del rumore ma le cuffie coprono così bene che sembra quasi che ci sia.-Sono eleganti e dal design moderno.-L'audio e il microfono hanno un buon suono solo in alcune app (discord) l'imput è basso e non si riesce ad alzarlo.-Buon raggio d'azione , copre circa la metà della mia casaContro⬇️:-A volte può richiedere un po' di tempo per ristabilire la connessione quando si accende, il che è fastidioso quando si ha bisogno di rispondere rapidamente a una chiamata-I padiglioni auricolari possono diventare caldi dopo un po', ma in gran parte ne vale la pena per quanto sono efficaci nell'isolare i suoni esterni.-La porta di ricarica sulle cuffie è piccola e difficile da localizzare.

    Spedizione: imballato con cura, rispettate le date di spedizione.Prodotto: ottimo prodotto, qualità prezzo eccellenti, materiale di costruzione plastica di buona qualità.Opinioni personali: il prodotto è ottimo sia cablato che non in quanto li posseggo entrambi, le utilizzo da più di un anno ogni giorno e non hanno grossi segni di usura, soprattutto la spugna che poggia alle orecchie è ancora come nuova. Per il loro prezzo l'audio è perfetto nessun calo di prestazioni. Le consiglio a chiunque sia per lavoro in quanto molto comode sia per gaming se si vuole un ottimo prodotto anche competitivo senza spendere cifre astronomiche.Può essere anche un ottima idea regalo.

    De titel van de review zegt eigenlijk alles. Op het eerste zicht lijkt de bouwkwaliteit beter dan verwacht, veel plastic maar de belangrijke componenten zijn in metaal uitgevoerd. Vrij zwaar aanvoelend product, wat zowel een voordeel als een nadeel kan zijn. Zit zéér comfortabel omdat het de volledige oorschelp omsluit en de randen van het oor dus niet schuren tegen de randen van de hoofdtelefoon. Wel wat warm indien lang gedragen. Audiokwaliteit is voldoende, zeker voor gamen, maar indien je deze hoofdtelefoon primair voor muziek koopt zou ik een ander product uitkiezen, al is ook daar de kwaliteit voldoende. Microfoon-kwaliteit ook voldoende met vrij goede ruisonderdrukking, volume standaard wat aan de lage kant maar dit kan omhoog gedraaid wordenVoor deze prijs zeker aan te raden, veel waar voor je geld vergeleken met anderen in dezelfde prijsklasse

    My old headphones suddenly died and as I game a lot - I had to buy new ones sooner rather than later. My issue is that majority of the headphones usually hurt my ears after wearing them for 1h + (not a glass wearer, just weird ear issues), so it was difficult for me to find ones that wouldn't do that.I went to my boyfriend and he let me tried his Corsair headphones for a few hours. I quickly knew - these are what I'm looking for. Found them here, cheaper than expected, and bought them. Got delivered very quickly. The build quality is good, they do not look like they going to fall apart after 2 months of use. The sound quality is very good, but I can't say if you can listen to classic music or hard rock in them with a A++ quality, as that's not what I use them for. They are quite heavy, but well balanced and comfy to wear. I like that the mic is attached, but if you tip it up it turns off, no need to press any buttons. I love the customisation. You can make your own light profiles: different light colours, different type of pulsing or switch the light off completely (which saves the battery). Battery life is good, I purchased the headphones about a week ago and didn't need to charge them yet.As summary: I was delighted to find something that doesn't hurt my ears, is very decent built quality, good sound quality, attached mic and no cable - all for a very good price! My boyfriend has got the same pair and been using it for about a year (more or less) and he's very happy with them too.

    Ho comprato questo prodotto per effettuare streaming online.A me non piace avere cuffie così grosse in testa, infatti il mio primo tentativo fu un paio di auricolari wireless ma con scarso successo. Dopo una ricerca abbastanza approfondita ho deciso per questo modello di cuffie per una manciata di motivi:- La marca- I cuscinetti in memory foam- Il tessuto in microfibra (invece che in pelle!)L'audio è spettacolare. Normalmente stereo, ma se collegato con l'usb con scheda audio 7.1 integrata si ha un effetto davvero incredibile. Il suo è perfetto anche ad alto volume. E' stracomoda. Non pesa sulla testa, i cuscinetti sono morbidissimi e anche col caldo, dopo diverse ore, la sudorazione è limitata.Il microfono non era una delle mie priorità, ma se lo è per voi allora questo prodotto non è adatto. L'audio registrato dal microfono è molto simile a quello di una semplice chiamata telefonica, ma molto limpido.

    Je recherchais mon premier casque Gaming. J'ai essayé le Fnatic Duel Gaming ... je l'ai retourné dès la première utilisation car le son était médiocre pour un casque à 150€. Comme j'avais tapis, clavier et souris Corsair je me suis dirigé vers leur catalogue, ce VOID m'a tapé dans l’œil !Les points positifs :+ DESIGN affirmé mais qui reste sobre. J'ai choisis la version SE car je trouve la couleur Jaune de chez Corsair sympathique et parce qu'il y a cette station de livrer avec, qui déporte le récepteur USB afin d'éviter des interférences.+ QUALITE de fabrication : J'avais peur d'avoir des bruits de plastiques de mauvaise qualité, mais au contraire la qualité de fabrication et d'assemblage est très bonne ! Les parties rotatives au dessus des oreillettes sont en aluminium qui sont du plus bel effet. Ce casque respire la qualité.+ LE SANS FIL et sa portée ! Qu'est-ce que c'est agréable de ne plus avoir à ce soucier du câble, de pouvoir se déplacer dans la pièce librement avec le casque pour continuer à discuter où à écouter de la musique. De base le récepteur et appairé au casque, c'est du Pug & Play, ce qui est top ! La portée est annoncée à 12m, c'est en effet le cas, du moment qu'il n'y a pas de murs porteurs sur le chemin. Je peux me balader presque partout dans ma maison sans décrochage. La portée de 12m est atteignable pour ma part même avec quelques cloisons, sur le même étage.+ LES SPEAKERS : Là où le Fnatic m'avait beaucoup déçu c'était sur la qualité audio (qui était donc très mauvaise). Là j'ai à faire à un bon casque, sans être excellent comme mon Sennheiser Momentum 2 (pas le même tarif mais pas le même usage non plus ^^), le VOID se débrouille bien, les différents préréglages de l'equalizer dans le Soft de Corsair ne sont pas mauvais. Certains diront que le VOID manque de basses, mais ça ne me dérange pas plus que ça, le préréglage Bass Boost comble en grande partie ce problème. En jeu sur CS:GO c'est un pur plaisir d'utiliser ce casque, il y a une bonne spatialisation une fois le mode Dolby d'activer, j'entends mieux les différents joueurs sur la Map et leur localisation. Vraiment, je suis satisfait de l'écoute que me procure ce VOID.+ LE MICRO : En lisant des reviews j'ai pu lire que le micro n'avait pas un fort volume. Personnellement mes compagnons de jeu ainsi que mes correspondants sur Skype m'entendent parfaitement et de manière clair. J'ai juste dû mettre un niveau d'activation de la voix pour ne pas qu'ils entendent ma respiration, mais en 2 secondes c'est régler. Le fait de lever le micro le désactive, ce qui est très pratique : pas besoin de chercher le bouton sur le casque (mais cela fait doublon pour une même fonction pour le coup.+ CONFORT : les matériaux utilisés et le fait qu'il ne sert pas la tête rendent ce casque plutôt léger et qui sait se faire oublier, malgré son poids importants (390g). J'ai été étonné pour le coup. Il peut donc se porter durant plusieurs heures sans risque d'avoir mal aux oreilles. Les porteurs de lunettes en seront également satisfait.Les points négatifs :- LE CLAMBING (maintient sur la tête) : le casque ne sert pas du tout la tête, je l'ai mis en point négatif car cela peut en être un pour certain. Pour moi ça ne me dérange pas, j'ai une tête assez grosse du coup il ne glisse pas, mais pour des plus petites têtes, un mouvement brusque et l'arceau est devant les yeux ;)- L'INDICATEUR du niveau de batterie : Il y a une Led sur le casque indiquant le niveau de batterie, mais placée sous l'oreillette donc invisible une fois sur la tête. Le seul autre moyen de le savoir et d'aller dans le CUE > Paramètres > VOID. Autant dire que ce n'est pas très intuitif. J'espère qu'il corrigeront cela à la prochaine MAJ du logiciel, pour que celui-ci soit visible sur la page d'accueil du CUE)- L'AUTONOMIE : elle est correcte, Pour ma part elle oscille entre 6h et 8h (sans RGB) avec un volume d'écoute élevé (50% CS GO, 20% GTA V, 30% Musique), mais le niveau de charge indiqué dans le logiciel de Corsair n'est pas précis, ce qui fait que je l'ajoute dans les points négatifs. Il m'est arrivé de voir le pourcentage de batterie bloqué à un certain pourcentage pendant 2h pour le voir après chuter. Une MAJ du Firmware peut sans doute corriger cette imprécision.

    I bought these gaming headphones last week at a reduced price of £79.00 which was 27% off after searching for a good pair for weeks. I asked all my gaming friends for recommendations and all of them listed different brands. I wanted wireless to say goodbye to the cord which kept getting wrapped around my chair with my old ones. 7.1 surround. A good quality microphone and speakers. A decent battery was also important as some of my gaming sessions on the weekend with friends can go on for hours. I got all of these things.WIRELESSThe headphones use 2.4GHz wireless frequency to connect to your PC witht he supplied adapter. It is essentially plug-and-play, with very little setup required (I discuss iCUE below). The range is great, I can go from all corners of my home and it never cuts out and I haven't noticed any latency with any game, video or song I listen to. I am still getting used to not being tethered to my desk with a cord anymore and realised today I can actually go and make a cup of tea while still talking to my friends now.BUILD QUALITYStrong plastic design with a lovely shape and adjustable headband. Combined with the comfortable ear rests which do a great job with external noise reduction, I happy with the quality of this product. I also love how the mic can be raised which mutes all input audio if for example you want to go to the bathroom but still want to listen to a video etc. The charging is fast (cable supplied) and has a great length in case you need it while working/gaming and the battery starts getting low. However, I've not needed to do this yet. The lights on the side are nice and funky and can be changed to suit your style.SOUND AND iCUEMusic, gaming and video sound quality ARE crisp, with a nice balance of bass. A massive upgrade to my old ELO headphones. The surround is amazing and I can hear the location of every footstep in my games. I have nothing bad to say about the sound quality, absolutley out of this world! I can also hear my friends a lot clearer in Discord calls. You can download the supported application iCUE which can change the colour od the lights on the side, change the levels of bass etc. You can pretty much customize the entire headphone experience via this software and I highly recommend downloading it. It also supports Nvidia Broadcast which only adds tot he overall sound and microphone quality.MICROPHONEWhen I joined a call the other day using these for the first time, my friends noticed a massive improvement to my voice quality. They background noise reduction works extremely well, and makes my voice very clear. I haven't tested this with games I own which use voice recognition yet but I am sure I won't have any problems with these either as after hearing my voice back, the feedback was faultless. Sounded like I was in a recording studio!OVERALLExcellent value for money, fantastic quality.

    Este es el segundo par que me compro, el último me ha durado desde 2019, unos 5 años aproximadamente. La batería apenas se ha resentido en todo este tiempo con un uso diario de muchas horas (aún que de todas maneras se pueden usar enchufados con su cable USB que es bastante largo).Son muy cómodos, cubren toda la oreja, aíslan decentemente, buena calidad de sonido (especialmente para videojuegos con el sonido envolvente), micrófono bastante bien, las almohadillas pueden ser reemplazadas fácilmente a un precio asequible (solo he tenidonque hacerlo una vez en 5 años).En definitiva, puede que no sean los mejores cascos del mercado en cuanto a calidad de sonido o micrófono, pero no tienen nada que envidiarle a los gama alta, ya que lo compensan con buena calidad, rendimiento y durabilidad!Ademas, tienen leds personalizables con la app de corsair (apagados el gasto de batería a penas se nota, y le da un toque al set up)Nota final 9.5/10

    good mic, and good sound quality. software is easy to set up and isn't terrible. the build quality is good and sturdy and won't break if you drop it once or twice. though i do wish it had a detachable cable, though it is just a personal preference, and it is comfortable.

    Ero indeciso se acquistarle o meno. Alla fine l'ho fatto e devo dire che sono rimasto molto soddisfatto. La qualità è ottimo, il prodotto arriva imballato perfettamente.La qualità del suono e del microfono sono ottime. Il suono forse non è altissimo, però è alto, e detto francamente devo tenere il volume del pc Windows a 40 quanto vedo una siete tv, quindi penso che sia ottimo, almeno per me.Il design è accattivante, io le ho prese bianche e nere e sono rimasto soddisfatto, il cavo è lungo e soddisfa ogni aspettativa. Beh che dire è corsair ed è un ottimo prodotto. Il colore lo si può impostare tramite pc.L'unica attenzione è che sono cuffie grandi, quindi potrebbe non andare bene a chi ha una testa piccola, a me per fortuna vanno alla perfezione, con un piccolo svantaggio forse. Del resto sono ottime

    before we go into the my review i need to point out I've owned numerous headsets from logi, HyprX, turtle beach over the years, so far i owned 3 Logitech (all broke), 1 Hyper-X (not ergonomic for me), 3 Turtle beach (wire gave up), but so far this is the best flipping headset I've seen, felt, and wore in a long time.firstly the built quality is absolutely amazing, from the moment i pulled it out the box, and put it on my head although the weight at first was quiet a bit off putting but I've wore this headset for about 6 hours in a row so far with limited breaks (mainly toilet and water breaks) and i have not taken the weight into account at all, i believe that it is extremely well distributed around the headset AND FOR ONCE i don't have to amputate my leg just to hide the pain i get from taking off the headset as others in the past were just so uncomfortable to wear so when you'd take it off it would leave behind an excruciating pain but this one HELL NO it is perfectly built.The sound quality honestly blew me away... the base, the voice clarity and also how versatile this headset is while using the iCUE settings. Versatility is a BIG yes on this one. I can play my games like, R6S, Hell Let Loose, Post Scriptum, BF 1, Stellaris, MOWAS2, SW BF 2, PUBG, cheeki bit of fortnite, League of legends etc... it is also amazing to listen to music in it.i will be updating this review within the next 3-4 weeks and so on and on for you people.  <<<<Update 1>>>>Alright it may have been more than about 4 weeks however i promised updates on this for you guys.<< Durability and versatility>>So far the headset hasn't shown any sign of breaking yet however i do use extreme precaution when using it as all 3 of my past headsets for pc broke in similar ways having the support for the speakers completely disintegrated within the first 4 weeks (Logitech). This one however is still strong and still feels like it is brand new, no damage, no sound bug, no weird buzzing sound or echos in the background. The ear cushion is probably one of the best that I've ever seen and used, i never had my ears burning up with them specially recently with the heat wave we just had... heat was never an issue. it is also very adjustable and i have a big head and even still i don't need to extend the size by that much and it is still great.<<Performance>>This headset is basically what you need for games, music, movies, video and music editing etc... the bass is not really ear or brain shaking by itself nor with the ICUE software which honestly is not a problem and most people just wouldn't care to be honest as the sound is already godlike as it is, but for me i just like bassy songs so i just downloaded a bass amplifier and i was all sorted.<<weight>>honestly it feels heavy but it isn't heavy if that makes sense? I think it is mostly due to how well it grips on your head which make it feel like that but overall i can have this headset on for like 10 hours with minor breaks in between and it still doesn't bother me. weight distribution is also on point!<<issues>>The only issue i have with it is the wire, it tangles after a while and it is hard to get it back to normal as some curves and knots remains, however it isn't that annoying and doesn't really affect the performance or quality but never the less it is there.Overall still an amazing headset.

    I've had these for 24 hours after returning the hyper x cloud stinger s 7.1 headset I had bought. Initially I was worried the 7.1 surround sound would have the same issues as the hyper x and that they wouldn't be comfortable as many have said but after having them recommend by friends who have the pro version undecided to take the plunge and boy am I grateful that I did . They are nice and comfortable not to loose ( I do have a big head ) the sound is amazing the voices from my friends while talking on discord is nice and clear with the mic picking up my voice nice and clear too . The noise cancelling is top notch as I vape and non of my friends could hear when I did vape it also cut out my music from my phone which I purposely turned the volume up to max and held the phone to the mic with no noise coming through only while I spoke . Volume control is super easy  switching from different sound settings is as easy as pressing the volume control on the left ear cup and switching from 7.1 to stereo is just press and hold the switch . You get a decent length of cable with a usb connection . Would I recommend these to people hell yeah I would and I'd buy them again if this set ever broke

    Ich habe mir das Corsair Void Elite RGB Wireless Gaming Headset für meine Playstation 5 gekauft und bin nach zwei Jahren intensiver Nutzung immer noch absolut begeistert von seiner Leistung. Dieses Headset ist ein absolutes Muss für jeden, der ein immersives Gaming-Erlebnis sucht, insbesondere bei Shootern.Der 7.1 Surround Sound des Headsets ist beeindruckend. Ich konnte jedes Detail in meinen Lieblingsshootern hören, sei es das leise Schleichen meiner Gegner oder die Explosionen in der Ferne. Der Klang ist klar und präzise, was mir einen klaren Vorteil im Spiel verschafft.Die kabellose Verbindung des Headsets ist zuverlässig und bietet eine Reichweite von bis zu 12 Metern. Ich konnte mich frei bewegen, ohne mich um Kabel oder Einschränkungen kümmern zu müssen. Die ultraschnelle Latenz sorgt dafür, dass der Ton synchron mit dem Gameplay bleibt und ein reibungsloses Spielerlebnis gewährleistet wird.Die Akkulaufzeit des Headsets hat zwar nach zwei Jahren etwas nachgelassen, ist aber immer noch voll ausreichend. Ich kann immer noch einen Ganzen Tag am Stück spielen, bevor ich es wieder aufladen muss. Das Aufladen selbst geht schnell und unkompliziert.Das Design des Headsets ist modern und ansprechend. Die RGB-Beleuchtung verleiht ihm einen coolen Look und lässt sich individuell anpassen. Der Tragekomfort ist ebenfalls hervorragend, auch bei längeren Gaming-Sessions.Insgesamt bin ich mit dem Corsair Void Elite RGB Wireless Gaming Headset äußerst zufrieden und kann es jedem Gamer empfehlen, der ein hochwertiges und immersives Audioerlebnis sucht. Der Surround Sound, die kabellose Verbindung und der Tragekomfort machen dieses Headset zu einem unverzichtbaren Zubehör für Shooter auf der Playstation 5. Trotz nachlassender Akkulaufzeit nach zwei Jahren immer noch 5 Sterne!

    Op zich ben ik redelijk te spreken over deze headset wat betreft geluidskwaliteit van de speakers en de microfoon.Waar ik iets minder over te spreken ben is de bouwkealiteit. Dit is ondertussen mijn tweede exemplaar. Eerste headset ging de mute knop van kapot binnen 3 maanden (Knop bleef hangen en stuurde meerdere inputs). Bij de tweede begint nu binnen nog geen jaar de power knop al wat te blijven hangen. Het flip to mute systeem van de microfoon is onbetrouwbaar. De ene keer werkt het prima, maar op andere momenten moet je de microfoon een tweede keer ""flippen"" voordat hij werkt. Het rode ""mute"" ledje gaat telkens wel uit, maar de mic geeft geen geluid door.Accu gaat ook wat korter mee dan verwacht en je moet de icue software blijven gebruiken om de leds op de oorschelpen uit te kunnen zetten. Dit kan dus niet via een knop en wordt ook niet opgeslagen.Ander minpuntje is micro usb voor het laden. Dat gaat minder lang mee vergeleken met usb c stekkers.

    Dopo aver avuto una brutta esperienza durata fin troppo con le precedenti cuffie da me acquistate, ho acquistato queste Corsair Void Pro in edizione speciale di colore giallo, in occasione di un'offerta lampo di Amazon.Ordinate ed arrivate nella stessa giornata ( Fantastico servizio Prime di Amazon ), queste cuffie, si trovano all'interno di una confezione sgargiante che mostra l'articolo acquistato e le sue caratteristiche.Al suo interno, una volta aperta la confezione, troviamo le cuffie avvolte da svariate pellicole di protezione e bloccate con un paio di lacci metallici plastificati.Al di sotto delle cuffie, troviamo la dotazione di questo modello che comprende :1) Un pratico manuale d'uso purtroppo non in lingua italiana ma in ogni caso abbastanza semplice per chi ha un minimo di conoscenza di base di inglese od in alternativa di : Francese, Tedesco, Spagnolo, Portoghese o Russo.Si, in effetti, l'italiano non sarebbe stato male vista la quantita' di lingue supportate.2) Un cavo USB > Micro Usb per ricaricare le cuffie.3) Una basetta con fondo gommato con prolunga USB per collegare la chiave WiFi al Pc in modo da posizionarla comodamente dove si vuole.4) Spugnetta antivento copri microfono.I cavi, presentano un buon design dei connettori anche se avrei preferito, al giorno d'oggi, vedere dei cavi con rivestimento in corda presenti anche su cuffie di fascia molto bassa.Passiamo alle cuffie che si presentano con un design futuristico ed un peso accettabile di circa 385 grammi.Una volta indossate, si puo' notare che non fanno molta presa sulla testa rimanendo poco serrate ed io mi sono sempre considerato uno dalla testa grande.Questo puo' essere considerato sia un pregio che un difetto.I pregio puo' essere il confort dopo lunghe sessioni di utilizzo, il difetto puo' essere quello dell'isolamento dai rumori esterni.I gamers, sono esigenti, vogliono tutto e non sono soddisfatti di nulla ma, anche ritrovandomi in questa categoria, con il tempo sono diventato piu' pragmatico e quindi sono per dire che non si puo' avere tutto ma l'importante e' avere un oggetto che esegua bene le sue funzioni principali.Nel caso di queste cuffie, per quanto mi riguarda, le funzioni principali sono :1) Qualita' dell'audio in entrata ed in uscita.2) Qualita' del WiFi.3) Durata della batteria.Dopo aver dato uno sguardo al manuale ed aver scaricato dal sito di Corsair il software di gestione, mi sono apprestato ad inserire la chiavetta WiFi sopra la sua basetta ed i drivers delle cuffie si sono installati automaticamente.Ovviamente, i drivers permettono di far funzionare le cuffie ma se vogliamo avere il totale controllo sul ns. nuovo acquisto, dovremo installare l'iCUE di Corsair che ci dara' accesso : ai settaggi per il 7.1, ad un equalizzatore, al controllo e gestione dell'illuminazione ed ad altre features dedicate alle Void Pro.Inserita la chiavetta, vengono installati rapidamente i drivers di gestione e le cuffie sono pronte all'uso.Anche senza iCUE il suono e' qualitativamente buono e potente.Installato iCUE...la storia cambia e quello che sembrava buono, diventa ottimo.iCUE, si presenta finalmente in italiano e con un'interfaccia semplice ma curata e dall'uso intuitivo.Essendo un software che permette di controllare piu' dispositivi, ha una schermata Home dove potremo scegliere il dispositivo da gestire.Cliccando sull'icona delle nostre Void Pro Wireless, entreremo nella pagina delle impostazione delle suddette potendo gestire gli innumerevoli effetti di illuminazione che vanno dal semplice lampeggio di un singolo colore alla modalita' arcobaleno.Il logo di Corsair presente su entrambi i padiglioni delle Void Pro si illuminera' in base alla nostra scelta.Ma potremo anche scegliere di non utilizzare l'illuminazione risparmiando alla batteria del lavoro extra e guadagnando una durata maggiore di utilizzo prima di dover ricaricare.Passando alle impostazioni dell'audio, troviamo 5 preset forniti dalla casa che vanno dalla valorizzazione dei bassi all'ottimizzazione per i film ma potremo creare altri profili a piacimento in modo da personalizzare la nostra esperienza con queste cuffie andando ad agire su un equalizzatore a 10 bande.Oltre a tutto cio', potremo scegliere se utilizzare la modalita' Stereo o Surround.All'attivazione delle suddette modalita' una voce ( Donna sexy ^_^ ) ci avvertira' del cambio di impostazione.Questo, avviene anche quando ruoteremo l'asta del microfono in posizione di utilizzo.La nostra amica, ci avvertira' dicendoci quando il microfono e' attivo o non attivo.Ho provato queste cuffie con un player audio con qualche mp3, ho visto spezzoni di film con un player video e le ho provate in game con un paio di titoli.Suonano bene, l'audio e' di buona qualita' ed il surround e' veramente piacevole laddove sia possibile sfruttarlo.Provate con un programma di chat vocale, risultano buone anche come qualita' della voce.Termino questa recensione parlando brevemente del WiFi.Ho avuto precedenti esperienze con cuffie da gaming WiFi ed ho patito non poco con i software di gestione.Con queste ho girato per tutta casa senza notare disconnessioni di alcun genere.Pro- Buona qualita' audio in entrata ed uscita.- Sono 7.1- Software di gestione completo ed intuitivo.- Un WiFi finalmente valido.- Isolamento discreto nonostante non siano serrate sulla testa.- Dotazione.Contro- Troppo poco serrate sulla testa.- Cavetteria non cordata.Come per altri articoli, mi riservo eventualmente di aggiornare tra un po' di tempo questa recensione anche per valutare la durata della batteria che ovviamente al momento non ho idea di quanto possa realmente durare.Al di la di questo, consiglio senza ombra di dubbio l'acquisto di questo articolo a chi cerca un prodotto con queste caratteristiche.

    Seit einigen Jahren schon bringt Corsair gute Komponenten auf den Markt.Auch die Corsair Void RGB Wireless und dessen Nachfolger, das Void Elite RGB Wireless.Diese Serie bietet einen sehr guten Tragekomfort wie ein sehr angenehmer Kopfbügel mit weicher Polsterung und gut ausgelegte, abnehmbare stoffüberzogene Ohrpolster.Der Sound ist bereits in den Standardeinstellungen sehr gut, kann jedoch über die Software (aktuell iCUE) an eigene Bedürfnisse angepasst werden.Auch die Gelenke und Verbindungen sind sehr stabil ausgelegt.Das Headset kann gleichermaßen komplett wireless oder mit angeschlossenen USB-Kabel genutzt werden.Nun zu den kleinen Schwächen (hier sollte Corsair noch dran arbeiten, dann wäre es perfekt):- die Akkulaufzeit ist auch bei abgeschalteter Beleuchtung und Stereo-Betrieb etwas kurz (wenn es gut läuft zwischen 6 und 12 Stunden, eher 6, dann ist Schluss). Zum Glück kann das Headset auch mit Kabel betrieben werden.- Der Anschluss für das USB-Kabel liegt etwas ungünstig (lehnt man sich nach links wenn man das Headset wegen leeren Akkus mal mit Kabel nutzen muss, drückt man unweigerlich gegen den Anschluss, was bei zu viel Druck zur Beschädigung des einzigen Ladeports führen kann).- Die Reichweite hängt stark davon ab, wo man den Dongle platziert (an einem USB-Port am PC hinten oder bei einem Monitor mit eher mittig dahinter liegenden Anschlüssen kann sehr störend wirken), ein kleiner Stand zur freien Platzierung des USB-Sticks mit USB-Kabel als beiliegendes Zubehör hätte bei dem Preis bereits dabei sein können.- Das Microfon nimmt einen relativ leise auf und (da per USB/Dongle verbunden) bietet es keine Microfon Boost Option. Also entweder ein stärkeres Microfon oder eine in die Software integrierte Boost-Möglichkeit bzw. die Option zum Pegel noch höher regeln könnte hier Abhilfe schaffen.Trotz der kleinen Schwächen ein zu empfehlendes Headset, ich liebe die Klangqualität und den Tragekomfort

    Dopo svariati anni di gaming, il precedente headset era arrivato alla sua fine. Ho deciso di riprendere lo stesso identico modello, in quanto mi sono trovato perfettamente. Cuffie comode, non eccessivamente pesanti, microfono buono e facilità di mutarlo semplicemente tirandolo su. Buona ergonomia ed in estate non ti scaldano eccesivamente con i padiglioni. La batteria dei miei due modelli sempre perfetta (anche dopo anni) e con ottima durata, quelle di un amico (prese usate come nuove) invece arrivate con un difetto, che le portava a scaricarsi repentinamente.Consigliatissime in ogni caso

    Premetto che ho acquistato queste cuffie in sconto per 65 euro. Constatato questo posso dire che per il prezzo pagato da me sono più che soddisfatto del mio acquisto. Alti davvero buoni, medi altrettanto se proprio dovessi dirgli qualcosa magari è sui bassi che pur non essendo male non sono troppo corposi. Suono pulito e microfono meglio della media. Soddisfatto per il mio acquisto e se comprate per un prezzo tra i 60 e gli 80 ne uscirete soddisfatto per l'acquisto.

    Corsair a name you associate well with gaming.Build: This headset is built to last. Plastic mold with metal swivel earcups and metal in the headband.Sound: The sound quality is insanely good. I hear everything clearly when playing all my favourite games. I also listen to music alot and these are also good for that. I would recommend downloading the software for some other options. The quality of the mic is is fantastic and it is Discord certified. No distortion or crackling.All the buttons are easy to access on the headset. Your mic mutes when when you lift it up and unites when pulled down.The headset is super comfy and feels so light when on the head. I game for hours at a time and it still feels as comfy. My ears sweat on my old headset but not on this.This headset is noted as being able to do PC and Console but you don't get the adaptor to do Console, that has to be bought separately (can be purchased on a ebay super cheap).I really love this headset and for £69.99 it was a steal.

    I have been using this for over 6 months now and it has proved to be a really good purchase.Sound quality : Really good, I use the headphones a lot to listen to music and I've never heard any distortion, the low and high frequencies are apparent, I can't moan reallyComfort : I need to wear glasses so large headphones can cause me discomfort in a short time, however I can wear these headphones for hours while wearing my glasses without fear for them being damaged, Perfect! If I had a niggle it would be that if I rock back in my chair the headphones can move, due to the weight I think, but i guess that is the price for having long life batteries in themMicrophone :  Difficult to comment here as I haven't really used them in anger, what I have noticed though is that the quality largely depends on the applications you use, e.g. using Discord gives you good consistent quality, Battle net will turn you into a Darlek if you raise your voice.Battery Life : Good, Batteries last a long time (5 hours I think) but not  as long as the box says they will.  The other thing is that it takes an age to fully charge them, and recommends that once charged the cable should be disconnected promptly afterwards (probably to preserve the overall life of the battery).  However the charge indicator light is effectively underneath the headphones if you use the stand which makes it awkward to check and to be realistic you are likely to charge them over night which could mean overcharging them for several hours if you're like me.  Make sure you have a USB-3 charger/hub to charge these with as it will dramatically reduce the charge time.  Trust me, a standard USB charger will take 24+ hours to charge them up.  I nearly sent them back when I first got them because it took 3 days to initially top them up.  However, on the plus side, you can use them while they are charging and the cable is unobtrusive and longNiggles : Because the headphones are bluetooth, you have to go through the Windows system settings to change the default audio output device.  This is really annoying and on older OS's has a tenancy to be either buried or inaccessible.  It would be really useful if Corsair built a menu option in there quick access app to allow changing of the default Audio output, otherwise download ""Audio Switch"" which isn't perfect but helps a lotPros:* Great sound quality* Great comfort (even with glasses)* Great battery life* Microphone is convenient, (quality depends on software used)Cons:* Battery charging time, Invest in a USB-3 charger/hub (seriously)* Can slide of your head if you tilt your head* Switching between speakers and headphone use though windows

    I bought a SteelSeries headset for Zoom and Teams on the advice of my Gamer son. I liked it and the wireless system works well - even though it uses USB-C and I had to buy an adapter.What’s that got to do with the Corsair? Well, when lockdown 3 started and schools went online, my 12 year old daughter needed a headset, so I gave her that SS set.This meant that I was back on a search for another set - and I thought ‘do I buy another SS set or buy what my son uses - a Corsair Gaming set?’ I researched, read up and looked around and came to the same conclusion that my son had - that these are very good value for money.For music I only use Bose as they suit my music choices, fit very well and sound superb. Yes they’re expensive but they are, for me, the best.When reading about these Corsairs, I saw posts that the fit isn’t great and the sound is not always what is expected. Now my online headphone requirements are modest; I’m no gamer but I am a songwriter and collaborate with my music partner regularly.These fit me nicely, the sound is great and I love the Mic which when you flip it up, turns the mic off. The American voice that states ‘Mic on / Mic off’ is annoying and perhaps you can turn it off - the software ‘iCue’ is easy to use and can control a host of other Corsair gadgets.My main gripe is the size of the USB Dongle - it’s the same size as an old thumb drive and could be damaged fairly easily. Unlike the SS version which is a lot smaller (but I accept that brings other issues).For the price I paid; this set is comfortable, very configurable (the lights on the sides of the headphone cup can be altered to your own taste like a lot of Corsair products), the mic flips up out of the way (and is turned off when in that position) and the overall sound of the set is very pleasing.You can adjust the sound to a variety of settings and although I’ve not played with that much, it does make a noticeable difference if you like that sort of thing and could enhance games.I’m very pleased with them and would recommend them.

    音や使い心地は特に問題なく、むしろ快適です。ゲームでの使用感も良好でマイクもメンバーから特に文句を言われません。問題は充電ケーブル(付属)を刺しているにもかかわらず首を動かしただけで充電が止まったりすることと、左側のマイクや充電ケーブル接続端子(USB2.0 micro-B)がある方から「カタカタ」と、中で何かがガタついているような音が聞こえる点です。右側も変な音が鳴っていましたが、原因がパッドと本体の間に黒いネジが一本挟まって居たといういたって簡単なことだったので取り出してからは特に問題はありません。はずれを引いたのかもしれませんが、ほかの方もご注意ください。

    Valgono quello che costano, sono riuscito a prenderle a 90 euro invece che 110 e posso dire con estrema facilità che sono le migliori che abbia mai provato.Comodità davvero elevata, quasi te le scordi addosso, spesso mi capita di andare in giro per casa con le cuffie senza rendermene conto, ovviamente regolabili a seconda della vostra dimensione, con cuscinetti in tessuto traspirante, perfette per l'estate.Per quanto riguarda la batteria, non sono sicuro siano 16 ore di autonomia, forse qualcosa in più addirittura.Per adesso mi sono trovato molto bene, l'audio è veramente molto buono, pecca un po' sulla nitidezza della voce, ma per il resto davvero una bomba.Microfono ok, funziona correttamente, può essere spento da un pulsante direttamente sulla cuffia sx oppure con la funzione ""Flip to mute"" ed in più il microfono si illumina di rosso per farti capire che è spento.se volete delle cuffie che valgano tutti i soldi spesi, vi consiglio queste.

    Scrivo questa recensione dopo oltre un mese di utilizzo. Ottime cuffie con padiglioni larghi che risultano molto comode e non troppo pesanti. L'arco che poggia sulla testa è rivestito di un tessuto imbottito e morbido che da una bella sensazione. Il microfono funziona perfettamente, non provocando rumori e fruscii (chiesto a più persone in conferenza). Dotate di un controllo del volume con levetta sul padiglione sinistro, che funge anche da bottone per attivare/disattivare il 5.1 (la differenza si sente anche se non è estrema).Possibilità di personalizzare i led sui padiglioni sia con colori che con movimenti diversi degli stessi, grazie al programma scaricabile dal sito del produttore, insieme a qualche altra opzione come per esempio l'inibizione dei rumori e suoni provenienti lateralmente al microfono.Inizialmente ho avuto dei problemi, poi risolti agevolmente: quando le cuffie erano attaccate sul retro del case a volte windows non eseguiva il boot, basta comunque non collegarle alle prime usb in alto della scheda madre o comunque disabilitando l'usb legacy dal bios.In sostanza ottime cuffie, suono chiaro e bella anche la confezione (in essa è presente anche una spugnetta per ricoprire il microfono). Ovviamente arrivate in men che non si dica grazie ad Amazon.

    Cuffie per pc e console, le cuffie hanno un bel design e sono comode anche se non isolano dai rumori e non riesci ad immergerti nel gioco..I controlli sui padiglioni sono comodissimi infatti dopo poche ore di utilizzo già si trova la posizione dei tasti facilmente.. nella scatola possiamo trovare cuffie, cavo jack da 3,5 e la scheda audio per collegare le cuffie al pc. Qualità dell’audio molto buona su pc con il 7.1 virtuale tramite il programma di corsair, ovviamente su console il 7.1 non funziona, però comunque anche su console la qualità dell’audio audio è buona, sentirete facilmente i passi dei nemici negli fps per esempio.Il microfono funziona molto bene, uso spesso la chat vocale con amici e mi sentono molto bene mai avuto problemi.. unica pecca è la qualità costruttiva che non è delle migliori..Comunque cuffie consigliate per chi usa sia pc che console e vuole avere solo un paio di cuffie che funzioni bene in entrambe le piattaforme..

    The audio quality is good, easy to set different profiles with iCue on your computer, but there are two major defects: battery duration, and the headset feels heavy.I end up charging the headset every very few days of use, and the cable provided with the headset itself wasn't working properly either, so I had to buy a new one myself.Also, the headset feels heavy on the head after a few hours, hurting a little bit.Overall, 4 stars, bought it on sale, I would have rather bought wired headset at this point, maybe, but it's still quiet okay.

    Cuffie molto belle e dalla costruzione particolarmente solida. Software di gestione completo, che permette di rilanciare la propria voce in cuffia, funzione molto comoda perché l'isolamento con l'esterno è estremo e risentire la propria voce è altresì gradevole. Molto belli i materiali, un po' caldo il materiale spugnoso delle cuffie che è rivestito di tessuto ma calza perfettamente all'esterno dei padiglioni auricolari. Ottimo il volume, che risulta già molto alto all'80% della regolazione. Il microfono ritorna una voce con frequenze molto fedeli e incorpora l'automatismo di auto spegnimento alla rotazione dell'archetto verso l'alto. In sostanza un ottimo ottimo prodotto, leggermente caro visti i prodotti della concorrenza.

    Bought this around a week ago now. It's an excellent headset.This is the 2017 version with the upgraded mic.The headset itself is made from a high quality plastic and metal frame, around the ears and head band there is a perforated foam which s extremely comfortable.Located on the left ear cup is also a mute button for the mic.Sound quality is very good for the headset although it does lack some low end bass during scenes with explosions, in the detailed sections of audio is where the headset really stands out, YouCan here with pin point accuracy where an enemy is located.Overall I'm very pleased with the headset and would definitely recommend.If you appreciated this review then please click the helpful button, it allows us to keep reviewing products like this for you.

    I don’t normally write reviews for products but these headphones are pretty dope. These are my first pair of gaming headphones so I’m no connoisseur by any stretch.. but I saw some mixed reviews on these which lowkey made me hesitant to purchase so thought I’d chime in. Personally, I’d recommend them. They work just fine and the sound is pretty great. For the price I wasn’t expecting BOSE or anything but definitely exceeded my expectations. I’m really into the depth of the base and these definitely do the trick. The volume switch is also on the back of the left headphone so maybe those who say the volume doesn’t work after a few days just need to turn that up? Idk. Overall I’m pretty happy with these. I play fortnite on my switch usually and sometimes I can’t tell if the sounds are from the game or outside my house.. that’s how decent these headphones are. Got the navy camo, they look so good. 5 stars.

    Amazing for what the price is. Good audio for both gaming and viewing. Deep base, quality sound. The headphones do a good job of drowning out background sound but not fully noise canceling. Same with the mic it picks up what’s close and does well but not great at drowning out background noise. Strongly recommend for the price.

    I bought these after thoroughly ready many of remarks.Wish the sound was higher. Even with the volume turned up all the way ( on the left side of the headphones ) you can still hear things around you.These are amazing ! Noise cancelling is great. ! Just enough bass. My husband games more than me and wants more volume out of them. But I find them just fine.  I don’t know why guys need it that loud. It has very good directional sound too while shooting and listening for things coming up our left and right.I would buy these again for sure ! Even though the sound could be louder for my husband. I think they ar great !Super comfy on BOTH our heads !

    Ich habe diese Kopfhörer mitlerweile 3 Monate benutzt und folgendes ist zu sagen:Die Kopfhörer klingen gut und das Mikro ist auch ganz okay.Allerdings dadurch, weil das Gehäuse aus Plastik ist und die Kopfhörer, an den Seiten drehbar sind, hört man ein relativ lautes knirschen wenn man seinen Kopf bewegt. Man hätte in meinen Augen, zumindest etwas besseres Material bei diesen Verbindungspunkten verwenden können.Fazit: Die Kopfhörer sind für ihren Preis okay.

    Natürlich steht hier die frage im raum was man für 30 euro erwarten kann… naja ich hab schon echt gute over ear Kopfhörer für solches geld gehabt, nur halt ohne mikro. Kuckt mal bei thomann.Zum positiven, funktioniert an der xbox ohne setup oder so. Reinstecken und fertig.Da hört es leider schon aufDas headset wirkt recht klapprig, es ist irgendwie komisch geformt, der bügel fällt so nach vorne, ich verstehe dieses design nicht.Tragekomfort… naja. Man kanns tragen, komfortabel ist das aber eigentlich nichtder sound ist OKAY, aber manchmal knistert, kratzt, rauscht es. Das habe ich bei meinen anderen kopfhörern nicht.Zum micro, es scheint zu funktionieren, aber der sound beim gegenüber ist wohl nicht gerade überragend.Alles in allem… vermutlich muss ich mir eine andere lösung ausdenken, da das mit diesem teil einfach unbefriedigend ist.

    The EPOS H3PRO Hybrid is the premium wireless headphone I have always been looking for. Essentially, just think of it as the Steelseries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless but without the external DAC. After around 4 month of using this headphone, I can say that it has brought me immense satisfaction.Everything about this headphone is just exactly perfect. Some people might say the volume wheel is trash but it just really adjust the volume based on each level of sound that can be offered to you by your laptop. If you didn't get that, what I tried to say is that there is nothing wrong with the headphone.For the ANC, it isn't ridiculously powerful but it definitely makes an impact. When you turn the ANC on, your sound will sound more close to you (rather than more spatial without the ANC). This isn't a downside by any means. It really is just a preference.The only downside of this headphone and it isn't a life changer either, is that you can't pause, skip forward/backward with buttons on this headphone. I hope they roll out an update that allows you to do this on the headphone itself.I bought this during a discount and I can say that I am extremely happy with it. It is still well worth your money if it doesn't offer a discount though.

    Pro's:The sound is warm and the application for windows is simple.Connectivity with Dongle and Bluetooth is flawlessCons:Bluetooth connectivity to windows offers no customization to the sound in app leaving a flat experience.You can only have a single Bluetooth device bound at once so if on console, using the 2.5mm jack is the only option to have both phone and console connected and even then it is a bit buggy.Around there bottom of the ears there is a lot of noise bleed from outside as the is little to no pressure placed on my ears from the headband. If you push the headband back to just on your crown it seals much better but feels a little awkward when looking down like it is about to slide off again.The ANC is a lacklustre feature due to the noise bleed and adds nothing to immersion.

    So i got the headset and initial experience was great - the sound quality was good to great (I see a lot of people complaining about lack of bass - i also found this to be the case unless anc was turned on for some reason? either an eq thing while anc is on, or a ""seal"" problem perhaps?)Either way, used them with anc on almost exclusively and they sound great. No issues with connection (via the dongle or bluetooth, bluetooth has some latency but the dongle does not, was impressed)A couple months down the line though the microphone started to crackle/pop when moved (sounded like when turning a volume knob with a dirty pot or something). This noise was actually picked up by the mic itself, and also only audible to the user with sidetone turned on. This got worse and worse, eventually the mic stopped working completely when it was fully extended. I had to use the mic at a slightly higher angle than ideal for it to even function.I contacted EPOS support who went through the usual pointless spiel of making sure my software was updated, even though i'd said multiple times it seems like a hardware thing. Each message took them 2-3 days to respond and they just came back with more and more questions, including multiple screenshots of the epos software running on my pc. They then asked for a recording of the noise itsef. By this time i'd given up waiting for their support to respond and just returned it to Amazon. At least Amazon respond in a useful and timely manner most of the time

    Acheté après avoir testé le Steelseries Arctis nova pro wireless , la qualité du son est pareil, l'Epos est plus confortable et n'a pas les micros de l'ANC qui rentre dans l'oreille comme le Steeleries. Seul la réduction du bruit active est un peu moins bonne que sur le Steelseries mais entre 380€ et 200€ il n'y a pas photo. Pour le reste je n'ai pas de problème de latence comme j'ai vu sur certains commentaires ou de micro qui grésille quand on le relève. On peut facilement enlever le mode veille automatique dans le logiciel pour info.En bref pour 200€ vous ne trouverez pas mieux.

    こちらは ANC (アクティブノイズキャンセリング)対応のワイヤレスヘッドホンとしての機能もあるし、スマホと Bluetooth接続しながら、PCゲームの音も同時に再生するというボイスチャット対応のゲーミングヘッドホンならではの側面も持ち合わせています。なので、いつもの自分のオーディオ部分に対する評価だけじゃないところを踏まえつつ、なのですが、やっぱりオーディオメインで評価します。マイクのゲインとか、音質などはしっかり評価してくれる相手がおらず…、この２か月間でチャットしたり、電話会議用に使った相手から悪い評価をもらっていないというレベルで、◎ と解釈しています。また、Bluetoothヘッドセットの場合、結構屋外での利用で、風切り音なども評価の対象としているのですが、こちらの製品は大きさや利用用途から、ほとんど自宅やオフィスだろうと解釈して、屋外での使用の評価はしませんでした。ANC対応のワイヤレスヘッドホンとしては、EPOSの前身となっているゼンハイザーらしさは感じられます。Apple はもとより、Boseの QuietComfort よりも密閉度が高く、ソニーの WH-1000MX3 よりもすっぽり耳を隠してくれる感じです。結果として、ノイズキャンセリングされにくい、人の声やテレビの音みたいな部分もかなり減衰してくれるため、かなり音にフォーカスできます。エアコンの音を消すのは朝飯前で、ゲーミングパソコンのファンノイズもまったく気にならないレベル。冬特有のものとしては加湿器の動作音なども、気になりません。これまで自分が愛用してきた ANC対応のオーバーイヤー型のヘッドホンとは、また違った味付けですが、ノイズキャンセリング力は強いと思いました。このANC力が強い前提なのでしょうが、非常に素直な音がします。音楽を聴いても、変にブーストしたりせずに、繊細な音を繊細なまま。低音も素直になっているまま再生してくれる感じです。密閉ゆえの圧迫感はありますが、音自体は、Bose のマルチメディアスピーカーなどで聴いているのと同じような音域です。詳細は下記にまとめましたので、参考になれば幸いです。1.まとめ-------1) ノイズキャンセリング性能　WH-1000MX3 ＝＞ Bose QuietComfort 25 ＝ EPOS H3 PRO Hybrid2) 音の繊細さ　EPOS H3 PRO Hybrid　＝　WH-1000MX3　＝＞　Bose QuietComfort 253) 低音　ほとんど差がない。強いて言えば Bose QC-25が強いかも。4) マイクの聞きやすさ　差なし価格帯はほぼ同じ 3万円前後の製品となっていて、ヘッドホンとしての再生性能は多少の個性もあれど、どれも高品位で、気持ちよく聴くことができます。差分もほぼ個性の範囲です。これに加えて、EPOS H3 PRO Hybrid はマルチな入力や、USB接続により低遅延接続などに対応しているという点が特徴と言えるでしょう。2.ノイズキャンセリング-------ノイズキャンセリング性能は、ゲーミングヘッドホンだからか、パソコンのファンノイズみたいなものや、キータッチ音みたいなところがほぼほぼ消えます。ただ、3万円クラスのヘッドホンなので、ライバルもみな同レベルで消えることを考えると、ノイズキャンセリング性能には差がないというべきだと感じました。前述のとおり、ヘッドホンとしての密閉度が高いです。このため高音域のノイズもほとんど気にならないのは特徴です。特に Bose QC-25 は、家の前の公園で赤ちゃんが大声で泣いていると、それが聞こえますが、こちらは良くも悪くもほとんど聞こえません。ものすごく遠くで泣いている感じに聴こえます。3.音の繊細さ、低音性能-------ノイズキャンセリングした状態では中低音が結構効いた感じの音です。高音の伸びはあんまり感じられませんでした。書斎の静かな環境でもそうなんで、この辺は H3 PRO Hybrid のドライバの特性もあるかもしれません。自分はクラシック、ピアノ曲、女性ボーカル曲が多いのですが、モニタスピーカーとほぼ同じ印象です。高音が少し伸び悩むくらい。一方で、ゲームなどに特有の環境音 (足音や近くに敵が来た音) などは、きちんと方向感もわかる感じで伝わってくるところがすごいなと感じます。この辺は、ソニーも Bose も、意外と丸めちゃっているところがあるので、音の定位をしっかり保つところは、考えられていると感じました。(参考) 自分評価のノイズキャンセリングの効き具合WH-1000MX3 ★★★★★★★★★★(10)Bose QC-35 　★★★★★★★★★(9)EPOS H3 Pro　★★★★★★★★★(9) <<= ここ※ 遮音性で優位性ありBose QC-25 　★★★★★★★★★(9)AirPods Pro 　 ★★★★★★★★(8)WF-1000MX3 　　★★★★★★★★(8) *条件ありATH-ANC300TW  ★★★★★★★★(7)AVOPT TE=D01t  ★★★★★★★★(7)GLIDiC TW-6100 ★★★★★★★★(7)WI-SP600N 　 ★★★★(3) *条件あり一般的なカナル型 ★(1)購入のご参考になりましたら幸いです。

    Alcune premesse:Io vengo da un paio di Hyperx Cloud Alfa cablate ed uno di Steelseries Arctis 9.Posseggo queste cuffie da una settimana  ed ho avuto modo di provarle e farmene un'idea. La sessione di utilizzo più lunga è stata di 4 ore. Da quando le utilizzo non ho ancora avuto bisogno di caricarle ed hanno circa il  70% di batteria residua.Cercherò di essere sintetico per evitare una recensione noiosa.PRO:1)Hanno un audio in cuffia molto buono. Voto 8,52) Il microfono funziona discretamente bene, chi mi sente dice che la mia voce ha una tonalità ""giusta"" e che mi capiscono sempre molto bene. Voto 8.3) Sono molto comode, dopo 4 ore che le indosso non danno nessun fastidio. Voto 9.4) Si possono connettere a tutto e hanno una connessione molto stabile e veloce, sia cablate che wireless. Voto 10.5) la batteria è decisamente sopra la media tra le migliori cuffie gaming. Voto 9.6) hanno un'estetica particolare, ma sono comunque eleganti, si possono usare anche in strada o a lavoro senza sfigurare. Si fanno notare senza essere appariscenti. Voto 8.7) Riduzione attiva dei rumori ambientali che funziona egregiamente, ma è pensata espressamente per abbattere il rumore delle ventole di raffreddamento di un pc, se usato per annullare i rumori di una strada affollata, è poco efficace. Voto 7.CONTRO:1) Costano tanto. Voto 4 e 1/2.In conclusione sono cuffie che non eccellono in nulla, ma il loro punto di forza è la versatilità. Sono ottime per il gaming, per il lavoro, per la mobilità (hanno il microfono esterno che si stacca e riattacca con un meccanismo magnetico) e vanno bene per ascoltare film e musica con un'ottima qualità audio, collegate al telefono permettono anche di telefonare senza problemi, (hanno anche un secondo piccolo microfono integrato) e poi sono dotate anche di riduzione attiva del rumore ambientale!

    Even though I paid for a *new* product, I received the headset in used condition. The manual was folded against the creases, nothing was wrapped in plastic, and there were several accessories un-banded. Regardless, I was anxious to see if the headset would work so I plugged in the USB dongle and started setting it up in Windows 11 Pro.I immediately ran into issues connecting to the EPOS Gaming Suite software, but I expected as much, based on the reviews. Plus, I own an older Sennheiser Game One headset with driver issues (Sennheiser and EPOS gaming headsets used to be the same brand).The driver issues with this headset are pretty much the same as my older headset. You can get audio to come through fine with plug and play (legacy drivers) but if you want to connect to the EPOS Gaming Suite, you’ll need their proper drivers. It’s also worth noting that the EPOS Gaming Suite software worked when I connected the included USB-A to USB-C cable to the headset… but who wants to use a cord with a wireless headset?So, I needed to get the USB dongle working or I was going to return the headset. I screwed around for a couple hours updating firmware, uninstalling/reinstalling drivers and software, until I was about ready to print the return labels. Then finally I made one simple change, and everything worked. I went to Device Manager -> Audio Inputs and Outputs -> Headset (EPOS H3PRO Dongle) -> Update Driver.Boom. Everything worked.I admit this hassle isn’t ideal for the average consumer; however, I’m glad I stuck with it and got it working. As far as the actual hardware is concerned, I'm totally satisfied. It sounds and feels better than my old headset. It has a snug fit that only slips when you tilt your head too far forward. The ear cups are firm, but cushioned, and do well to form a good seal. The volume limit could stand to be a little louder, but the clarity is very good. You aren't going to get thumping bass or anything, but frequencies are well separated and clear. The software also has an equalizer to play with. There are 2 surround modes - 2.0 does well for louder stereo music, and 7.1 is good for most games/movies. The noise cancelling is kind of strange as it only seems to cancel lows - like the sound of my voice, but it’s not bad. The wireless aspect is amazing and battery life is an absolute non-issue. I plug it in whenever I’m done using it (usually 14-hour sessions), and I’ve never had it reach less than 60% charge. You can also attach it to the USB-A to USB-C cable which is about 6 feet long if the battery dies. I haven't used Bluetooth so I can't comment on that.Overall, the hardware is great, the software isn't bad, and the driver support is lacking. If you use the USB dongle like me, just update the drivers in Windows and you should be good to go.

    So after a lot of researching for a good set of wireless headphones, i finally settled on these.  I've been using them for about a day and this is what i've found so far using them.The Good.They're comfy to wear.  Haven't done any super long sessions with them yet, but i didn't feel like my head was in a vice. I've got a big head, so that's a winner in my books.  Also you can wear them with glasses and not feel like they're trying to push them through your head.The build quality so far looks and feels solid.  They look premium and feel it too, which is what you want when you're about to spend this kind of money.  The ear cups feel good and didn't noticeably make my head feel warm or hot.  Not sure how that will be in the summer though.The sound quality is good.  These are primarily aimed at gamers and not audiophiles.  The sound definitely focuses more around the bass.  If you like that kind of sound profile like me, i feel you will like these.  Again, they were good for watching movies, and were ok for music.  Comparing them to my Sony WH-1000XM3, you're going to notice the difference.  However, i didn't buy these for the reason of listening to music, i bought them for gaming.Battery life, so far it's pretty good.  If you're in a long session and run out of battery you can plug them in via the USB C connector to your PC and carry on, just like if they were wired.  However, i haven't tested this in anger to see if what EPOS claims is true.I love the detachable mic.  It's one of the main reasons i went with these.  I have a desk mic, so wasn't fussed about the microphone.  So i can't comment if the quality of the mic is any good.Connecting them to my PC was super simple.  Honestly, plug the dongle in and turn them on.  Let the PC do the rest.  That simple.Now for the OKThe desktop software is not great and is by far my biggest issue.  There's is a huge amount of room for improvement here.  This is what i have found so far.It feels a strange mix between keeping things simple, and not providing enough to actually use it properly.I found it took a little while for it to realise you have the headphones wireless connected.  And when it does connect, i found it forget my previous configuration.  For example, if you had them configured for mode 2.0 and then shut down your PC.  When you next load it up, the mode will be back to 7.1.  This gets tiring pretty quickly.  We'll call this a bug (feature) for now.As mentioned above, I've noticed when plugging them in and going back to wireless there is a lag in the software.  There isn't in the headphones, it's instant.  Which is good, but again points to another bug potentially.You can only tell how much battery life is left from the desktop app when you're using the dongle it seems.  Not a huge issue, but it would be better if you could tap the power button and it told you.  Further to that, when you turn them on it does tell you the battery life.  However, if you have 100% battery, it will tell you you have more than 80% battery left.  I found this pretty annoying, as i want to be specific.You can only access the troubleshooting option from the system try EPOS icon by right clicking on it.  Not from the main app, which means it could easily be overlooked.  Even then, the troubleshooting guide seems separate as it listed a completely different model of headphone.The volume wheel doesn't feel as good as my previous Sennheiser wired headset.  It's an infinite rotation, so no min or max to it.  However, it just doesn't feel as smooth to me.  Which if i'm honest, i'll use very little as my keyboard has a great volume wheel on it and i use that already.The ANC just feels not good at all.  Honestly, i couldn't tell the difference when it was on and when it was off.  It definitely didn't block out the sound of my typing when it was on.  Also, It's either on or off, there's no ANC profiles so you can configure how sensitive you want the ANC to be.  When it is on though i found you got this strange white noise background.  Which was just annoying.  If you want ANC, i would say don't get these for that reason.Some nit picking issues.There's no L and R markings on them.  This isn't a problem when the microphone is connected, but when it's removed, i've found myself checking which way round they should be before putting them on.  This will obviously fade with time as i get used to them.The box they came in didn't exactly scream premium.  An odd thing to pick up on i know, but if you're about to drop this kind of money on some gaming headphones you want the full experience right?ConclusionAm i happy i got them?  Yes, definitely, they're good wireless gaming headphones.  The main issues i have with them are things which can be fixed through updates.  I got these for gaming and watching the odd TV/Film on my PC.  I'm not about to go and listen to my music collection with these, as there are better options when it comes to that.As you can tell my main issue with them so far is the desktop software.  EPOS really need to step it up here, as it letting down a good product.

    Ce casque EPOS H3Pro Hybrid arrive dans une simple boite en carton noir, dans laquelle on trouvera le casque avec ses divers câblesEt notices en images et texte.Je vous le dit de suite, le dongle Bluetooth usb est branché sur le câble USB, cela vous évitera de le chercher partout comme moi, surtout qu'il est très petit.Le casque este très qualitatif et le choix des matières judicieux, il est assez léger et confortable, surtout sur de longues périodes de port.Il risque de l'être un peu moins en été si il fait chaud, mais c'est le cas de tout les casques.Il est compatible avec le port de lunettes.Les cache oreilles sont très agréable et assure déjà une réduction de bruit à elle seule,qui pourra être renforcé par celle que propose l'électronique du casque (assez efficace)Niveau connectivité, c'est la fête !Bluetooth, USB, filaire mini jack et même sans fil USB via le dongle fournie (souvenez vous, celui qui se cache :)Ayant testé les 4 modes sur divers appareil, aucun soucis à noter.L'autonomie et correcte et me convient parfaitement. Le réglage du son se fait via une molette sur le côté droit et on a au total 3 boutonsOn/off, bluetooth et marche/arrêt réduction de bruit.Concernant la restitution sonore, mon avis est celui dun utilisateur lambda, qui écoute de tout, donc je serais probablement moins sévère qu'un audiophile ou un mélomane.Que se soit pour l'écoute de musique, la bande son des films ou encore les appels téléphoniques tout est reproduit avec fidélité et qualité.Sa principale utilisation étant pour moi le jeu vidéo, il est parfait, sa réduction de bruit est un plus et le dongle usb fonctionne parfaitement sur PS4, et personnellement j'apprécie son côté très sobre ce qui est assez rare chez les casques de gaming.Le micro se coupe facilement en remontant le bras à la verticale (qui est optionnel et amovible)Ce casque aura été pour moi une belle découverte, d'une bonne qualité, le prix est cependant très élevé (279€) et à ce tarif, le casque pourrait au moins être accompagné d'un sac de rangement.Merci de m'avoir lu, si mon commentaire, mes photos vous ont été utiles, un petit clic est toujours appréciable pour moi :)

    Ich habe ein Sennheiser 560s (Kopfhörer) zusammen mit einem Arc MK2 (DAC/Verstärker)Was zusammen ein super Setup für Spiele ist und ich eigentlich sehr zufrieden bin damit.Dennoch wollte Ich dem EPOS H3Pro Hybrid eine chance geben da es im gegensatz zu seinen vorgängern mit einer 2.4 GHz Dongle (30ms Latenz gemessen)  ausgestattet ist und im gegensatz zu meinem Setup halt eben Kabellos ist.Das Headset ist qualitativ für gaming Headsets gut, jedoch nich für den Preis.Bügel mit komischen Stoff überzogen, Lautstärke Drehrad schrecklich, Mikrofon naja, aber ich möchte hier gar nicht gross auf das eingehen.Sound ist dank der Software individuell mit Profilen einstellbar und funktioniert auch gut.Das Headset macht alles was es soll ganz anständig, der Sound ist dank der EPOS Software individuell einstellbar und funktioniert auch.Jetz zum grossen no-go und was mitunter auch der Grund ist wieso ich es zurück gebe.Wenn man das Headset abschaltet wechselt Windows nicht automatisch auf deine Lautsprecher was halt einfach sehr sehr sehr schlecht ist und im 2022 einfach nicht mehr akzeptabel ist.Mir ist klar das solche Probleme mit Firmware Updates zu beheben sind, die Frage ist nur wann und ob. Sehr schaade den dass Headset und die Software dazu sind eigentlich ganz gut, nur muss das ganze muss halt eben auch mit Windows funktionieren. Wichtig zu erwähnen ist auch dass ich von der 2.4 GHz Verbindung am PC spreche und nicht von 3.5mm TRS oder Bluetooth.

Collegamento alla ps5 tramite Dongle è perfetto, collegamento alla tv tramite bluetooth perfetto, suono cristallino, tramite software da scaricare su pc si possono cambiare svariati settaggi.

    Great audio quality, but the earphone arm snapped after six months making them useless. EPOS initially refused to replace it saying it was my fault, but came back later and admitted that was a mistake. They sent me a brand new headset.Pros:Great sound qualityComfortableGood noise cancellingLong battery lifeCons:Temperamental bluetooth that keeps needing to be unplugged to connect to PC.Poor range - starts breaking up after a 1-2 meters.No way to know if the damn thing is on until you hold the on/off button which obviously turns it off if it is on! Then you have to wait until it lets you press it again.Iffy quality control.

    Update 4/21/2023 - Headset mic now makes insane crackling when lowering. Replacing this headset. Lasted 3 months of heavy use (8 - 12 hours / day).Update 2/2/2023 - Dropping to 1 star. Headset constantly loses wireless connection even when sitting right next to the dongle. I bought this to be wireless, not wired to a desk. AVOID THIS HEADSETTL;DR - These look pretty, but the performance & software leaves a lot to be desired. For $200 less, you can get G935s that come with G-Hub which is wayyyyyyyyy better than ""Epos Gaming Suite"", they're not as good looking (IMO) but they perform way better than these.This review is as of Software version 1.11.0.1102, should future updates correct any of the issues I mentioned, I'll update my review.Looks - 5/5, A very gorgeous headset. I have the Matte Green / Gold combo. Detachable mic for public spaces make it more socially acceptable.Comfort - 4/5, Very comfy, you know you're wearing them, but by no means are they heavy like some. No digging into the top of the head or anything like that. Sticks to my head great, I've worn them to work out a couple times.Build quality - 5/5, seem sturdy, no complaints here.Sound quality 4/5 - With ANC off, it sounds great. Turn on ANC, and you hear this constant ""white noise"" static.Connectivity - 2/5, From time to time, the head set will get crackly for no reason after an extended period of use. When starting my day there are times where sound will not come through the head set unless I restart it once or twice. For some reason, the headset has trouble switching from PC to smartphone when making a call. Its 2023, why is this an issue? Bluetooth has been around for a while now... Lastly the dongle range is pretty bad. 10 feet and I get a lot of static and/or cutting in and out of audio. Much worse that my old G935's. Only edge they have here is that you can stream sound sources from bluetooth and the dongle at the same time (As long as its not a phone call).Software - 2/5. for $300, I expect to know exactly what my battery level is. The app simply tells you if its 80% or 40%. No exact %'s. my old G935's were able to, why is this even an issue? A whopping 4 sound presets. Movie, Esports, Music and Flat. You're able to select 2.0 or 7.1 surround effect and add reverb (why?). Otherwise still a lot to be desired from the software point of view.Battery life - 4/5, No complaints here other than what I mentioned about about the battery level indicator. Still has ~40% battery after a 10 hour work day with music playing all day.Microphone - 3/5 For some reason, after a long session I'll need to restart the headset because the mic feedback becomes 'roboty'. Incredibly annoying.Noise cancellation - 0/5, ""ANC"" as they call it here. Does absolutely nothing. If anything it seems to enhance the outside sound and create a ""white noise"" static in the background.Volume control - 2/5, annoying to say the least. Its a circle on the side of the headset that annoyingly difficult to adjust. Just make it a scroller wheel, much easier.Past headsets I've owned--Beyerdynaic MM150 (Best Mic & Noise Cancelling)-HyperX Cloud Stinger-Logitech G935 (Best software & sound)-Logitech G933-Corsair Void Pro RGB-Turtle Beach Ear Force XO

    Took a risk in buying the Epos H3Pro Hybrid, which were more expensive than the average for the quality of the product. I got for 280€ :- a terrible software support, the EPOS Gaming Suite is still in my opinion a very lacking software in terms of features, functionnalities, quality of life, and ease of use.- an average battery life, considering the less expensive alternatives- Bad dongle connection, I have lost connection too many times to count while using the headset, and had to unplug replug the dongle, or switch off and on the headset, for it to work again.- Sound strongly lacking in bass.- Headset is comfortable, but the earpads are a bit too small for my taste, and cause ear pain after a while.- I sometimes hear a very high-pitched continuous sound in the left ear when I am not listening to anything, which might come from the antenna.- The volume wheel is horrible, it increments in steps that are way too large, and is bad design overall.- Microphone sound quality is average, if you want an excellent microphone, avoid this headset. The removable microphone option is good, and the pull up to mute function is appreciated, however.Overall, I regret my purchase, and if you hesitate between this headset or the logitech G pro x wireless, go for the logitech. Its microphone is much better, more software features and better battery life, and much less expensive.Tldr : too expensive for bad software, bad dongle connection, bad battery life, average microphone, and died after a year of use (in completely normal conditions, wasn't used for travel or heavy movement). Don't buy this headset.

    C'è da dire che sono, assieme alle Corsair Virtuoso RGB Wireless XT, le uniche cuffie da gaming che possono funzionare ""CONTEMPORANEAMENTE"" sia con il dongle e sia con il Bluethooth.Spiego meglio: se stiamo giocando al PC (cuffie collegate con il dongle), possiamo contemporaneamente (se associate e collegate ad uno smartphone con il bluethooth), possiamo rispondere alle chiamate o ascoltare della musica ecc senza interrompere l'audio proveniente dal PC.PRO:- Connettività doppia in contemporanea 10/10- Sono leggere e comode. Inoltre i padiglioni, nella parte che poggia attorno alle orecchie, sono in velluto, quindi non scaldano eccessivamente la zone circostante le orecchie  9/10- Batteria buona, come da dati dichiarati (con il mio uso Dongle + Bluethooth circa 28 ore senza ANC) 8/10- Buona la qualità e l'opportunità di mutare il microfono alzando l'asta e anche la possibilità di rimuoverlo (è presente un ulteriore microfono interno per quando si è in giro) 8/10CONTRO:- Se collegate con il dongle o con cavo 3.5 (in dotazione) hanno un ottimo sound, con bassi profondi, ma se si ascolta la musica con il bluethooth, a causa della mancanza del codec AptX, sentirete un leggere gracchiare. Male visto che costano 280€  6/10- Il software per gestire le cuffie è abbastanza scarno e presenta dei piccoli BUG  4/10- La funzione ANC (attivabile con uno switch sul retro del padiglione destro) non fa altro che inserire un lieve rumore bianco (tipo fischio di orecchi). Epos non la può chiamare ANC... non serve a nulla 1/10- Sono di plastica, abbastanza anonime 3/10Alla fine ho deciso di renderle perchè avendole pagate circa 280€ mi sarei aspettato di più dall' ANC, dalla qualità costruttiva, ma soprattutto manca una borsa per il trasporto :(

    Lamentablemente, no puedo recomendar éstos auriculares.Hace tiempo que quería sustituir mis Steelseries Arctis 7, dado que me apretaban bastante, pero no salían modelos nuevos interesantes, hasta que vi éstos EPOS.Sobre el papel me convencieron bastante, por el hecho de que se pueda conectar a varios dispositivos a la vez, y que tengan el pedigree de Sennheisser (aunque ya sean dos empresas aparte), a parte de juguetes con ANC, etc.Percepción de calidad vs precio:Cuando me llegaron, directamente vi que la calidad percibida no está a la altura de casi 300€ de precio, es puro plástico todo. Por otro lado, se suponía que han de ser super cómodos, pero la diadema es relativamente estrecha y las almohadillas no son muy profundas, entonces las orejas tocan los drivers.Tecnología:De cara a la tecnología, primero, el prometido ANC (insonoración de sonido activa) es muy, pero muy mediocre, de hecho, apenas notas diferencia alguna, realmente, no sirve de absolutamente nada en éstos auriculares. Por otro lado, configurar los auriculares es bastante doloroso, entre que las instrucciones no explican nada , y luego una vez instalado todo, sigue sin detectarlos, etc etc., estuve 40 minutos peleando para hacer que funcionen en PC de trabajo por Bluetooth y en el Gaming por USB (y eso que no soy un patán tecnológico, trabajo en la industria digital).Sonido y micrófono:Y, finalmente, el sonido. La calidad del sonido es buena, de hecho, sería lo único bueno que puedo decir de ellos. Pude escuchar música con buena calidad, tiene un espectro de sonido bueno y claro, con bajos medios y altos bien balanceados. El surround sound propietario de EPOS es decente, pero no llega al nivel de Atmos o DB:X (los cuales suelen venir con los Corsair o SteelSeries). Ahora la otra cara de la moneda del sonido - el micrófono. Lamentablemente, muy malo. Mis compañeros dijeron que sueno muy robotizado, y que sonaba hasta mejor con mis Arctis 7 de 2017. También se me comentó que a veces el microfono “saltaba” a muy mala calidad de por si solo, lo cual solo se solucionaba reiniciando los auriculares.Calidad:Y, matiz final de algo que me he percatado, al mover el auricular derecho, se cortaba el sonido de él por completo, hasta moverlo de nuevo, donde se reactivaba. Dudo mucho que sea intencional, y lo voy a firmar como otro fallo más de calidad.Resumen:Resumiendo, he tramitado la devolución de éstos auriculares, dado que, para mi, no valen el precio que he pagado por ellos ni de cerca. He optado por unos Corsair Virtuoso Wireless XT para sustituirlos, los cuales son 50€ más baratos. Veremos si se nota diferencia.

    Really disappointed after seeing some nice reviews about this headset.The main feature that I wanted was the wireless aspect, being able to move more freely when talking and playing was a huge pro. However, whenever using this as bluetooth or even with the dongle, it will cut out every 30 seconds or so which was supper annoying when communicating on discord or in game.The same would happen when using it for listening to music on my phone, the audio would cut out for a second or so, consistently.The build quality is great, plenty flex and microphone cap replacement is a cool feature.Active noise cancelling works fine but you can easily hear the buzzing in your ears.Microphone is okay on 3.5mm, USB, Bluetooth and Dongle connections, nothing crazy which is the norm for headset microphones.The sound quality isn't anything special, pretty flat in my opinion, I'm sure some adjustments can be made for better quality.

    The build quality is excellent, the gold and green (in my case) looks very stylish and understated. The packaging and accessories are all of a very high standard, but for a piece of equipment in excess of £200, I was expecting much more in terms of sound quality on a console…I bought the H3PRO Hybrid on the strength you can customize the audio and save the ‘Profiles’, via Windows software. I thought these profiles would be saved to the headset, just as they can be saved to my Logitech G933 Artemis Spectrum wireless headset and also a pair of Turtle Beach's I had prior to the Logitech's. But, how wrong I was.If you are a PC gamer, you can tweak the audio and mic to your liking via the EPOS Gaming Suite and save these custom profiles. They sound great on PC and, importantly, *only* on PC.However, I’m a PS5 gamer, and I was disappointed (to say the least), to find that you have to suffer the flat equaliser setting and there’s absolutely no way of changing it. No bass, treble or 7.1 surround sound enhancements whatsoever; just the flat, bland response you would expect from a graphic equaliser with all the sliders set to zero. You could be forgiven for thinking the sound was coming from a much cheaper headset than it is.What’s more, there’s nothing in the manuals or software which states these custom profiles can only be used on a PC and no mention of this fact on their website. It was only when I called their support line that I was told they only work on PC!!I wanted to like this headset so badly, but for a premium, top-of-the-range £200+ device, the very ordinary, bland sound on a console is a huge let down.

    Like others, I wanted to like this headset - it had all the features I wanted and had so many connectivity options that I was going to use it for literally everything.Except, the microphone input will frequently cut out and randomly begin to stutter when using the headset wirelessly using the included dongle. Friends will beg me to mute my mic so that I don't assault their ears.Pros:Amazing audio quality after you download their software and tweak the equalizer. Out of the box the headset uses a flat EQ profile, I got rid of that pretty quickly.Lots of connectivity options, you can even have the headset simultaneously connected to one device while connected via bluetooth to the other. It can play audio from both devices simultaneously which was pretty interesting but I doubt I'd actually use it like that.Cons:Wireless performance is incredibly sensitive to all sorts of interference, and this ended up being the reason I'm returning this headset.Ear cups eventually get pretty warm and uncomfortable after a few hours of continued use.-----Let's talk about the wireless dongle and why I'm returning the headset. Out of the box, the documentation includes diagrams that suggest that it's prone to interference; it suggests that the dongle should only be plugged into USB ports that are at the front of your computer/device, and not to connect the dongle into any ports on the back of the computer. Instead, you should use an included extension cable if you do need to use a back port, so that the dongle isn't back there.Ok, sure. A little bit of testing quickly demonstrates why this is necessary - the headset can barely tolerate any obstacles between itself and the dongle. Audio was jittery and choppy if you didn't have the dongle in direct line of sight (it was indeed completely unusable when using a port in the back of the computer).Even when using the extension cord, while audio was always clear as long as I stayed nearby, the microphone would frequently begin to stutter and would be nonfunctional for ~15 seconds at a time. This happened maybe once an hour. Between changing USB ports and testing using and not using the extension cable, I could not fix this.-----All in all, this could have been a great headset. I'd initially just assume the microphone issue was somehow my fault, but there are so many reviews of other people complaining about how unreliable the wireless connection behaves.Back to hunting for another wireless headset!

    購入して使い続けて3か月ほどで、ブームアームの上げ下げでのミュート機能が効かなくなった。旧ゼンハイザーコミュニケーションの時代からヘッドセットを愛用して使い続けてきたが、H3PROは品質が悪いのではないのか？と感じてしまう。1年半から2年は問題なく使い続けられると信じて買ったが、EPOSになってからダメになったんじゃないか？製品の各種機能は満足しているが、すぐに故障するものと思って買ったほうが良いかもしれない。

    Can't believe I spent most of the time since starting working from home using earphones from my phone on my PC.

However, this isn't indicative of its durability or its performance.Despite the somewhat less-than-premium tactile experience, the Jabra Evolve 20 UC more than redeems itself with its consistent performance. After several months of use, this headset continues to work flawlessly, showing no signs of wear or deterioration in audio quality.The Jabra Evolve 20 UC Wired Headset's reliability and user-friendly features were so impressive that I bought a second one for use in the office.

    For what you pay, you get a usable, enterprise entry level headset. It works. You paid under a hundred bucks. The mic is pretty incredible. If it's raised up, people can't hear me because of how directional it is. When it's pointed at my mouth, people can't hear others talking nearby. That's exceptional performance in my books. If I need another headset like it, I'm buying the same brand and model or better.I didn't know PC headsets mics could be this good. If you're used to more expensive enterprise stuff, this might be a big downgrade for you, but as a residential end user, this was a huuuge upgrade for my work Teams calls. It also has a toggle button to mute or unmute that comes in line in the cable with a big red light so you aren't saying the wrong things at the wrong times. It lets you know.A+++

    This headset has good sound quality and noise cancellation, and I would have kept It if it was comfortable for my large head (23-1/2"" circumference at eyebrow level). Although I could position the earpieces over my ears, they pressed in too much because of my head size, and I wouldn't be able to wear them for hours during the workday. The exposed foam ear covers felt scratchy and didn't look durable. These could work well for someone with normal head size, but I had to return them.

    Som bastante audível. Microfone de qualidade.Cancelamento de ruído do microfone não é o melhor, se baixarmos o som para os 70% torna-se possível, por exemplo, ter música de fundo na mesma divisão sem ser perceptível, no entanto o cancelamento não é dos melhores.Para o preço e considerando ser a gama mais baixa dos headsets JABRA, é aceitável, mas considerando o volume do mic nos 70% ou inferior. Com o volume nos 100% o cancelamento de ruído praticamente não existe.Mesmo nos 70% ouve-se, por exemplo, o teclar do computador.Avalio positivamente uma vez que enquanto falo,  apesar de distorcer um pouco a voz, de facto anula o barulho de fundo, mesmo com barulho ou música alta, sendo o discurso 100% perceptível.Agora se pretende um micro que não grave esses barulhos, música, ou pessoas ao lado nos momentos de silêncio, procure uma gama superior.Quanto a saída de som, avalio muito positivamente, não é noisecancelling, ouve-se que se passa a volta, mas também consegue anular um pouco do barulho para nos deixar concentrados na tarefa.O som parece me de bastante qualidade. Claro que não ser excelente para bpm's mais altos mas faz o trabalho na perfeição, caso o intuito seja ouvir uma música ''normal'' ou ver um filme ou uma série, ou para conversar ao telefone.De facto, a realidade é que para o preço, e tendo em conta o mercado não se pode ter grandes exigências.

    今まで数千円のヘッドセットを使用していましたが、バッテリーに問題があったり音声機能に難が多かったので、値段が高いですが思い切って購入しました。音声機能はさすが、Jabraといった感じです。が、使用を始めて2週間くらいから、ヘッドバンド部分がカタガタゆるゆるとなりホールド力が無くなりました。自分は頭が大きい方なので、だいたいきつくて悩まされます。使用開始時点はちょうど良かったのですが、この短時間で使用に耐えられないくらいゆるくなってしまったので、何度か壊さない程度に手で内側に曲げて使用しています。あとイヤーパッド（スピーカー部分）、本体をぶら下げているだけで落ちてきます。

    Easy connection to phone and computer so I can use the same headset for my calls and teams meetings which is really convenient. I can hear crystal clear and people initially could hear me really well however after a recent update via the app I'm getting the sense that people are struggling to hear me on teams, so much so my last meeting ended with us doing by phone as it wasn't working, the headset worked on the phone fine so I will watch and assess over the coming week.  Apart from that it connects quickly and automatically every time you turn on after initial pairing and I love lifting the mic for muting which is excellent when on teams calls. Overall seems to be a really good headset

    Returned two of these. Certified for teams.  Both randomly emit a dangerously loud white noise mid conversation.  Jabra blame it on Microsoft.  My trusty logitech H800s have no issues despite being made prior to teams even being invented.  Jabra support don't want to know and suggest raising with Microsoft which is akin to throwing a sausage up an alleyway. Not comfy to wear either in my opinion.  Overpriced incompatible garbage.

    Bought these as I was fed up needing to be attached to or in very close range of my laptop whilst on a call, as with previous headphones. These are high quality, comfortable to wear and enable me to walk around whilst on a call if I need to. Sound quality is great and crucially noise cancellation is brilliant too - great for when you’re working in a noisy office! The headset is size adjustable so you can tailor to your needs. Bought these on Prime day and they were well worth the money with the discount.

    Good battery life, but the microphone does not stay in the storage position, the magnet, will not hold it, while not the end of the world, if it say it does it, it should.Okay, so after using these for a few weeks, the range of the headphones has decided to drop from about 10 metres to a couple of metres, the mute function on longer works, and if the mic is not a certain position the mic doesn't work. Tried call customers services, but they seem to be constantly on training.So overall a complete waste of money. Will now have to go a buy another headset.

    En remplacement de mon précédent casque j'aurais similaire mais filaire, le bluetooth est bien pratique bien qu'ici limité à 2 devices simultanées. J'ai quelques soucis en passant d'un device à l'autre, parfois c'est comme s'il n'était pas connecté donc j'ai tendance à allumer/éteindre le bluetooth pour contrer ce problème. Sinon et vu que j'ai de l'expérience avec ces casques, j'espère que les coussinets dureront longtemps. En tout cas pour de l'usage intensif (télétravail par exemple), c'est vraiment très confortable à utiliser toute la journée, on entend bien et on est bien entendu, le casque est léger et ne fait pas mal.

    Nach langem hin - und her habe ich mir dieses Headset für mein Homeoffice gekauft. Dir Frage war DECT oder Bluetooth.1. Das Bluetooth hat noch vom Arbeitszimmer in die Küche, durch das Wohnzimmer bis ins Schlafzimmer funktioniert. Durch die Alu-Balkontür hat es dann kapituliert, wobei man aber eine Sprachmitteilung über den schlechten Empfang bekommt. Aber da ich es mit meinem Handy kopple und man das Handy überall hin mitnehmen kann, hat man quasi überall Empfang.2. Die Sprachqualität ist sehr gut, wurde mir zumindest von mehren Kollegen auf Nachfrage so mitgeteilt. Hindergrundgeräuche wie die Kaffeemaschine oder das Radio werden herausgefiltert :-)Ebenso ist die Klanqualität sehr gut.3. Hat man am Handy Bluetooth angeschaltet, verbindet sich der Kopfhörer automatisch, sobald man ihn anschaltet. Das lästige Suchen und koppeln fällt also weg, die Kopplung geht sehr sehr schnell.4. Es hat einen bequemen und guten Sitz.5. Ich führe pro Tag etwa ein bis 2 Stunden Gespräche. Der Akku hält mehrere Tage ohne aufzuladen. Man hat das Gefühl, dass er ewig hält. Aber auch während dem Laden kann man ihn problemlos nutzen.Ich würde jetzt ja etwas negatives schreiben, finde aber nichts. Vielleicht der Preis. Aber das sehe ich immer so: Wer billi kauft, kauft 2 x. Hier sicherlich nicht!Darum gebe ich eine klare Kaufempfehlung.

    Purchased in September 2022 and in January 2023 the earphone broke off the headband. The plastic connecting the earphone to headband is a 3-4mm circle.  The unit was replaced free of charge by Jabra. Now to July 2023 and they broke again. This is a design flaw and inherent weakness.

    Buscaba unos auriculares inalámbricos y con micrófono, que no pesaran y fueran cómodos.Lo primero que tengo que decir que es cuando lo pedi, en un auricular sonaba una pieza suelta y era muy molesto en el oido. Lo mande a descambiar y el siguiente vino igual, así que asumo que los auriculares son así (aunque me parece raro).En cuanto al producto en si:* Calidad del audio: Calidad normal, ni buena ni mala, pero para lo que yo lo necesitaba (videollamadas y algo de música van bien)* Cancelación de ruido: totalmente inexistente, aunque en la descripción aparece* Comodidad: Son realmente cómodos, y por mas rato que los lleves puesto ni te pesan ni molestan en las orejas.En resumen, por el precio que valen creo que deberían dar algo mas de calidad, yo lo cogí con una buena oferta y por eso puede que me lo los quede, pero por el precio original no creo que merezcan la pena

    I purchased these as I was getting fed up with the wire on my current headphones and wanted the freedom to move around while on calls, however this item is not fir for purpose. The volume on these needs to be at level 50 whereas my previous headphones would be fine on level 20. The volume up to level 30 is very feint and really not great when you are alone in a quiet office. I would urge to think about buying something else.

    Employé dans le milieu pro par des personnes ayant une activité de support ==> besoin de confort et d'un bon son (HP et micro).Ce casque ne peut s'appareiller que sur 2 périphériques bluetooth maxi. Dans notre cas d'utilisation, il est appareiller avec un PC et un portable. Il bascule sur le portable automatiquement quand on décroche, puis reprend le PC quand on raccroche. Bonne autonomie. Appareillage très simple. Pas d'interférence avec d'autres appareils bluetooth.Bref hormis le nombre de périphérique pouvant être raccordé, rien à dire: très bon matériel, mais un peu cher...

    Ich telefoniere viel beim Spazierengehen und habe ein Headset gesucht, das bequem zu tragen ist und Umgebungsgeräusche wie Straßenlärm beim Sprechen gut abschirmt.Leider ist das Evolve 65 aus folgenden Gründen letztendlich nicht für mich geeignet:- Ich habe einen recht kleinen Kopf und selbst bei der kleinsten Einstellung ist der Bügel etwas zu groß/weit für mich, und ich habe ständig das Gefühl, dass das Headset vom Kopf rutscht, speziell, wenn man das Mikrofon hoch- oder runterklappt.- der Ton ist ziemlich leise. Es ist unangenehm, den Lautstärkeregler ständig am Anschlag zu haben, und sich trotzdem noch konzentrieren zu müssen, um den Gesprächspartner zu verstehen.- das Mikrofon dürfte zwar Sprache gut übertragen, schirmt aber kaum Nebengeräusche ab. Sogar normales Atmen wird vom Gegenüber als ""Orkangeräusch"" betitelt.Positiv ist mir aufgefallen (leider nicht ausreichend, um das headset zu behalten):+ stabile und unkomplizierte Bluetooth-Verbindung+ unaufdringliches Design und praktische Bedienung

    Je suis déçu. En fait il y a un problème générique avec le Bluetooth pour tous les casques : Si on veut un son wifi, on prend toute la bande passante et on perd le micro. Si on veut le micro, il réduit la bande passante du son et il se met à sonner creux. J'espérais que Jabra fonctionnerait mieux avec son dongle fourni mais ce n'est pas le cas : Ca reste du bluetooth classique, peut être avec une meilleure portée mais pas de meilleure qualité. Connecter le casque nous en déclare en fait deux sur windows, un avec ""bon son"" (il dit ""stéréo"") mais sans micro, et un autre avec ""mauvais son"" et micro, il faut choisir. Le connecter en filaire ne change pas le résultat. Pourquoi prendre un produit cher dans ce cas ?Par ailleurs, ce casque est posé sur les oreilles et il ne tient que par la pression qu'il exerce dessus, c'est gênant à terme et ça fait un peu mal avec des lunettes.Bref je préfère un casque bluetooth sans micro, moins cher et plus confortable, qui aura un son de qualité, et un micro correct posé sur la table à côté, on en trouve pour pas très cher qui fonctionnent très bien. Une alternative est de trouver un casque filaire qui sera de qualité pour le micro et le son...

    Es ist ein gutes Headset, sitzt gut, scheint mechanisch stabil, auf Arbeit hab ich es auch und da leistet es gute Dienste. Die ganze Phone-Integration ist überflüssig, einfacher Support für Kopfhörer und Mikrofon würde ausreichen, aber da gibt's sicher auch Abnehmer für.Das Hauptproblem ist der Bluetooth-Standard selbst. Ich zocke was, oder höre Musik - satter Sound. Ich joine nebenbei Mumble oder einen Discord-Sprachkanal - die Musik wird kurz unterbrochen und kehrt dann BRÜLLEND LAUT in 90er Jahre Kofferradio-Qualität zurück. Aua.Was ist passiert? Ein Programm hat das Mikrofon angesprochen. Der Bluetooth-Treiber schaltet daraufhin vom A2DP-Profil (gutes Audio) zum HandsFree-Profile (bestenfalls Telefonqualität, aber halt mit Mikrofon-Daten). A2DP hat halt gar keinen Kanal fürs Mikrofon, und das Headset versucht schon klug zu sein und holt HFP erst raus, wenn ein Programm das Mikrofon haben will. Aber dann gibt's halt im Bluetooth-Standard keine Optionen mehr.Der Support ist aber echt gut. Ich hab nur ein bissl den Chatbot auf deren Website gepiesackt und hatte plötzlich ein Support-Ticket offen, auf das auch tatsächlich ein echter Mensch nach wenigen Stunden reagiert hat. Der hat dann so durch die Blume gesagt, dass es mit Bluetooth halt nicht anders geht.Ich schicke das Ding jetzt jedenfalls zurück und hole mir ein Gamer-Headset. Einige davon nutzen nämlich einfach ein eigenes Funkprotokoll und haben all diese Probleme halt nicht. Dann kann ich halt nicht mehr gleichzeitig ne LED-Leiste oder meinen Kühlschrank ansprechen oder wasweißich.

    Sounds excellent, but the last model I had of this, my cat kept yanking out the cable. Which is at a 90 degree angle for some inexplicable reason so it broke the external soundcard. But if you get the wireless one, you need a USB hub of no higher than USB2.0 to put some distance between your USB 3.0 ports and the dongle. USB3.0 interferes with the dongle so bad that it's almost not usable.That said, this is the best sounding headset I've ever used (aside from MAYBE the original Pulse 2) and I'm already pretty careful with my things so a little extra care isn't a big deal.

    Ho avuto diverse paio di cuffie negli anni, sicuramente queste sono le migliori. Sono leggere, non da fastidio l'utilizzo nemmeno per sessioni prolungate.Si nota dai materiali, è tutto minimal e principalmente in imbottitura.I padiglioni sono fantastici, io ho orecchini di medie dimensioni su entrambe orecchie sono le uniche cuffie che riesco ad usare senza doverli togliere. L'imbottitura sull'archetto è comoda, ma scivola un po'. Niente di preoccupante, basta non toccarle spesso.Passando all'audio, sono rimasto piacevolmente sorpreso. Il suono non distorce, è bello pieno sui bassi e meno sugli alti, ovviamente sono cuffie da Gaming e ci sta che sia così. Sicuramente non sono da studio di registrazione.Annullano i rumori esterni, ma solo se è il volume è abbastanza alto. Se ad esempio si parla in call è fastidioso il rimbombo della propria voce in cuffia, mentre si gioca invece passa in sordina.Molto comoda la regolazione dell'audio sulla cuffia sinistra.La scheda audio USB da un boost di qualità e di potenza che è impossibile non notare. Per chi come non ha schede audio è perfetta, in più permette la gestione ancora migliore di tutte i possibili valori dall'applicazione della Razer per desktop. La cosa buona è sicuramente che loro montano un attacco Jack, quindi si possono usare anche su cellulare, anche grazie alla possibilità di sganciare il microfono se non si necessita l'utilizzo. Quando si usano al desktop però, consiglio di unirle alla scheda audio USB.Il microfono va bene per il Gaming, mi si sente chiaro e senza intoppi.Unico problema, di cui veramente sono infastidito è il filo. Per quanto sia in tessuto, si intreccia di continuo. Penso che le prossime cuffie saranno wireless, perché non ne posso più. Quello in foto è un intreccio facilmente risolvibile, ma quando il filo non è in tiro fanno molto peggio.Per la fascia di prezzo, non credo si possa avere di meglio. La mia recensione quindi è scritta principalmente per chi cerca qualcosa su questo prezzo.

    Un casque dans la globalité super bon, un boost des bass qui va rendre les musiques vraiment superbe. Une qualité sonore dans les FPS qui vas vous permettre de déterminer avec précision où est l'ennemis. Franchement un casque superbe. Le THX rend tout vraiment superbe, je n'ai jamais entendu un son aussi puissant et net que celui-ci.Mais il y a un mais. Le casque vous rend tellement immersif dans votre jeu que vous n'allez plus rien entendre autour de vous, genre littéralement plus rien. Quand vous jouerez et que vous aurez de la musique, cela va vraiment perturber le son. Il n'est pas fait pour du multi son, même en vocale sur discord le son sera atténuer c'est dommage.N'étend clairement pas habituer à cela, de mon côté cela m'a donné des vertiges et un mal de crane après 3H de jeux. Après je suis sensible au bruit du coup ça n'aide pas.Mis à part ça je ne peux que recommander ce casque, il vaut son prix!

    I researched for two days on which headset I would buy. I'd just gotten an ASUS Strix laptop, a headset is essential due to gaming laptop fan volume! What became very quickly apparent was website, after website, after website having this model at #1 in their lists, often above far pricier models.This seemed weird, too good to be true so I started doing more research. I went to rtings website and got a list of every headset on the market, and began comparing the specs and reviews of the Blackshark V2 against top end, highest priced sets, and mid range ones in the same price bracket. I also did this process on other well known tech websites. The results were astonishing! This headset got rated better than models 2-2.5x the price! After probably 10 hours of researching and cross referencing I felt there was no other option and decided on the special edition model.I've tested it out now and I am blown away. The sound quality is astounding, the best I've experienced with a gaming headset - easily. It was rated as having very good neutral sound (true sound, without muddying from effects and enhancements), and it really does. Everything is crystal clear, bass sounds are punchy without distortion, mid range is all there, and treble sings. Also, the noise cancelling is excellent, it keeps the 49db fan noise of my machine completely silenced to my ears. The headset is also incredibly comfortable, and I have very sensitive ears so make of that what you will. I find the build quality fantastic.The sound card and synapse app that allow EQ customisation is a true game changer. Any minor shortcomings the audio range may have can be completely rectified and bring out the full potential of these amazing headphones. To that end I found a brilliant guide from a music producer on reddit and I heartily recommend these settings:In Synapse:Keep volume below 75 (74 is recommended, this is to prevent audio outs which can occur at higher levels). *This doesn't affect the physical volume using the knob on the set*Turn all enhancements off.Set custom EQ with these in the following order: 0, 0, -3, -3, +1, 0, +3, -1, -4, +8THX Spacial is personal preference, I personally use ""Dolby Atmos For Headphones"" on my laptop as I find it superior, but there are a fair amount of games that specifically use the former, so I'll experiment.Overall this is a truly exceptional headset, especially considering the price. I'm a solid loyal customer from now on, I look forward to a V3 down the line!10/10

    Ich habe mir dieses Headset aufgrund des schicken Designs und der USB-Soundkarte zugelegt.---Tragekomfort 5/5---Vorweg habe ich mich natürlich über Tonqualität und Komfort informiert, letzteres war mir als Brillenträger mit empfindlichen Ohren besonders wichtig. Wie viele andere Rezensionen schon bemerkt haben, ist das Headset sehr leicht und weich, sodass man fast das Gefühl hat als würde man es gar nicht tragen, eignet sich also sehr für lange Sessions am PC ohne schmerzende Ohren zu kriegen. Komischerweise fühlt es sich jedoch so an als würde die linke Ohrmuschel langsam runter rutschen. (könnte aber auch meiner Kopfform liegen. Wenn man 'nen dickeren Schädel hat, hat das Headset sicherlich mehr Anpressdruck und rutscht nicht.)---Tonqualität 4,5/5---Der Ton klingt ziemlich ausbalanciert, klar und etwas bassiger (wie von Gaming-Headsets gewohnt). Wenn das einem nicht gefällt hat man jedoch genug Einstellungsmöglichkeiten in der Razer Synapse Software (die bei mir anfangs das Headset nicht erkannt hat, nach einem Update von Synapse ging es dann.) Obwohl ich normalerweise kein Fan von simuliertem Surround-Sound bin, muss ich sagen dass ich vom THX Spatial Audio positiv überrascht bin. Man hört z.b. Schritte/Schüsse von Gegner wirklich merkbar genauer!---Mikrofonqualität 5/5---Über das Mikrofon ist man gut verständlich, ein Pop-Filter ist dabei und in der nicht-X-Variante ist es sogar abnehmbar, heißt wenn man mal ein separates Mikrofon kauft, hat man nicht immer eins nebem dem Gesicht hängen. Das Noise-Cancelling ist bei weitem das beste das ich je getestet hab. Nicht mal wenn man wollte würde es Hintergrundgeräusche von anderen Leuten die reden, PC Geräusche, Tastaturanschläge, Mausclicks oder lautes Atem aufnehmen. Jedoch klingt das Mikrofon, wenn man es über die beiliegende Soundkarte angeschlossen hat komischerweise etwas dumpfer als wenn man es über den herkömmlichen AUX anschließt.Andere coole Features: abnehmbares Mikrofon (nur für die nicht-X-Variante vom Headset, USB-Soundkarte die den Sound am herkömmlichen PC nochmal etwas aufpeppt (ebenfalls nur für die non-X-Variante), Volume Knob an dem man die Lautstärke am Headset selber ändern kann (der sich aus irgendeinem Grund an der linken, anstatt der rechten Seite befindet?) und ein Mute Switch.---Overall 4,5 oder 5/5---Ich habe das Headset für ungefähr 80€ anstatt den normalen 129,99/119,99€ erworben und würde deswegen sagen, das die Endbewertung davon abhängt, für welchen Preis man an das Headset kommt, denn 130€ sind schon etwas dicke.für ~80€ - 5/5für 129,99/119,99€ - 4,5/5

    PArtiamo dal presupposto che la spedizione di amazon è sempre la migliore, detto questo passiamo al prodotto, un headset molto bello alla vista pulito nel design e quando le indossi non le senti neanche da quanto sono leggere. le caratteristiche principali di queste cuffie sono 2: 1) l'insonorizzazione quasi totale dal mondo esterno è una cosa incredibile senti solo il gioco-film-serie tv 2) l'audio spaziale è assurdo, grazie al razer synapse ti permette di fare qualsiasi modifica e quasiasi settaggio audio per permetterti di avere l'audio migliore in ogni contesto. Io le uso principalmente per il gaming e sento rumori che prima non sentivo con le cuffie precedenti. La  schedina audio compresa nell'attacco permette di avere un audio ancora piu pulito. Prodotto top di gamma per i miei gusti molto soddisfatto ed entusiasta dell'acquisto

    ignore all the stupid reviews about the bad mic and the connection and whatnot ive had one of these headsets since day one and im still using it now and just orderd the siege version just for a different colour really. so connection issue ive never once had a problem at all. the only bugging thing from time to time is the razer app as we all know can be a bit of an annoyance setting the headset up can be pretty difficult to but once set up right in the app my god does this headset bang. you can hear most fps games 10 fold with footsteps no problem and the bass is beyond ridiculously good same as the sound quality as for the mic everyone says is subpar my friends are streamers and they say the quality is just as good as some of their equipment which is probably 3x the price of what a set of these would've cost brand new at £180 / £200 rrp.  as for the clamp and headset build its one of the best I've ever had the head clamp is still as good the headband hasn't even deformed or gone flat and its 2 years old. really comfy and really light as i wear glasses i struggle to find a good comfy headset that doesn't hurt my ears and this is the only headset that performs on all those fronts as well as being super reliable. just wish razer had put type c or a wireless charge dock variant of this headset out because its really worth it. 10/10 headset had astros a50s and they broke in 3 days crap headband clamps and same with artic pros they're terrible

    Aún no lo he probado conectado con la clavija; pero con la tarjeta USB no necesita tocar nada para tener un sonido excelente. El micrófono también se oye estupendamente.Es además muy cómodo. La profundidad de 2cm de las orejeras es suficiente para no oirse los latidos. Si se oyen es suficientemente bajo para que desaparezcan mientras se oye algo.No son tan grandes como las imágenes me hacían esperar, con lo que tampoco resultan estéticamente feos.Si tuviera que poner un pero, sería que las orejeras de tela quedan empapadas con el sudor, ya que calientan mucho las orejas. Pero espero que no se pelen como todas las de polipiel.

    BT600の5200UCとBT700の5200UC、どこが違うか調べてみました！最大の違いは充電ケースでしょうか。BT600のモデルのケースは隠れるようにドングルを収納していたのですが、BT700は表にドン！とあります。ドングル自体も違っていて、BT600は360度LEDが光る仕様ですがBT700は片面にのみ光る場所があるのでUSBの取り付け方によっては光が見えないかもしれないでしょう。本体はpolyのロゴに変わっている以外は特別変わった点は無いように思えます。過酷な環境では使っていないのでノイキャンとかもしかしたら進化しているかもですが…本体、充電ケース共にMicro USBでの充電という点は同じです。正直言ってここがUSB-Cになっていたら神仕様だったのですがそう美味い話は無いようです。あと写真にもありますがどちらもメキシコ製です。上がBT600の箱で下がBT700の箱になります。とりあえずは以上です。また何か気づいた点があれば都度追記していきます。

    Il Poly Voyager 5200 UC è uno di quegli auricolari che sembrano pensati apposta per la vita di tutti i giorni, soprattutto per chi non si ferma mai. Immagina di dover fare una telefonata mentre il vento si alza o sei in una strada trafficata e i clacson non smettono di suonare: con questo auricolare, la tua voce arriva chiara e limpida dall'altra parte, come se fossi in una stanza silenziosa. È leggero, comodo da indossare anche per ore, e la batteria dura abbastanza da accompagnarti per tutta la giornata. Oltre a questo, la funzione di avviso vocale sulla durata della batteria rimanente è una di quelle piccole chicche che non sai di volere fino a quando non le hai. Se sei sempre in movimento o se il tuo lavoro ti tiene incollato al telefono, il Voyager 5200 UC potrebbe davvero fare la differenza.

    Das Headset ist ein professionelles Bluetooth-Headset, das ich seit ein paar Monaten regelmäßig benutze. Ich bin sehr zufrieden mit dem Headset, denn es eignet sich für den Einsatz im Büro, unterwegs und zu Hause. Es verfügt über eine hohe Sprachqualität dank Noise Cancelling, das unerwünschte Hintergrundgeräusche reduziert. Ich kann damit klar und deutlich kommunizieren, auch wenn ich mich in einer lauten Umgebung befinde.Ein weiterer Vorteil ist die Möglichkeit, das Headset mit meinem Smartphone und meinem PC gleichzeitig zu koppeln. So kann ich nahtlos zwischen Anrufen und anderen Audioanwendungen wechseln. Das Headset hat auch eine praktische Sprachsteuerung, die mir erlaubt, Anrufe anzunehmen oder abzulehnen, die Lautstärke zu regeln oder den Akkustand abzufragen, ohne einen Knopf zu drücken.Das Aufladen des Headsets ist sehr einfach, dank der mitgelieferten Ladebox. Die Box hat einen integrierten Akku, der das Headset bis zu zwei Mal aufladen kann. So kann ich das Headset auch unterwegs nutzen, ohne eine Steckdose zu suchen. Die Box ist außerdem kompakt und leicht zu transportieren.Die Gesprächsdauer des Headsets ist beeindruckend. Ich kann bis zu 14 Stunden lang telefonieren, bevor ich das Headset wieder aufladen muss. Das reicht für einen ganzen Arbeitstag oder mehrere Tage bei moderater Nutzung. Das Headset hat auch einen Bewegungssensor, der erkennt, ob ich das Headset trage oder nicht. Wenn ich das Headset abnehme, werden die Anrufe automatisch auf mein Smartphone umgeleitet.Das Headset ist sehr angenehm zu tragen, da es ein geringes Gewicht hat und sich gut an mein Ohr anpasst. Es hat ein schickes Design und eine matte Oberfläche. 3 unterschiedlich große Ohrpolster sind aus Silikon gefertigt und fühlen sich weich an. Dadurch kann ich das Headset problemlos über längere Zeiträume tragen, ohne Beschwerden zu haben.Fazit: Das Poly Voyager 5200 UC - Headset mit Ladebox ist ein hochwertiges Produkt, das mir viele Vorteile bietet. Es hat einen guten Klang und eine gute Rauschunterdrückung, die mir eine klare Kommunikation ermöglichen. Es ist mit meinem Smartphone und meinem PC gleichzeitig koppelbar, was mir Flexibilität gibt. Es ist einfach aufzuladen, auch unterwegs, dank der Ladebox. Es hat eine lange Gesprächsdauer und einen Bewegungssensor, die mir Komfort bieten. Es ist leicht und angenehm zu tragen, mit einem schicken Design.Ich vergebe dem Headset fünf von fünf Sternen, weil es mich überzeugt hat und meinen Erwartungen entspricht. Ich würde es jedem empfehlen, der ein professionelles Bluetooth-Headset sucht und bereit ist, etwas mehr Geld auszugeben.

    Da ich durch meinen Job sowohl viel im Büro als auch unterwegs bin, war ich auf der Suche nach einem Headset was beides abdecken kann. Mit dem Voyager habe ich das nun gefunden. Es ist ein toller Kompromiss aus Mobilität und UC-Funktionalität bei verhältnismäßig hoher Akkulaufzeit. Ich nutze das Headset ausschließlich zum telefonieren und nicht für Multimedia und da macht es eine super Figur. Im Vergleich zu anderen Headsets dieser Größe werde ich endlich gut verstanden, das haben selbst teilweise deutlich teurere Headsets nicht besser, eher schlechter hinbekommen. Ich denke der lange Mikrofonarm nach vorne tut hier einen guten Dienst. Die Geräuschunterdrückung funktioniert ebenfalls gut und ich werde auch während der Autofahrt (Aussage vom Kollegen, er hört gar nicht, dass ich fahre) als auch in Anspruchsvolleren (=lauteren) Kundenumgebungen gut gehört.Die Basisstation ist super und mein Highlight ist der Dongle, so habe ich das Headset parallel mit dem Notebook (per USB Dongle) und dem iPhone (per Bluetooth) verbunden. Wenn ich dann los muss klappe ich das Notebook einfach zu und kann, ohne irgendetwas einstellen zu müssen, am iPhone weiter telefonieren. Das funktioniert absolut top und erleichtert mir den Arbeitsalltag enorm.Ansonsten empfinde ich das Headset als angenehm zu tragen, ich habe relativ große Ohren und da passt es super dran, auch ist es angenehm leicht, sodass ich es nach ein paar Minuten gar nicht mehr bewusst wahrnehme.Von mir eine absolute Empfehlung für einen tollen Allrounder sowohl im Büro als auch unterwegs.

    Been using this headset for the past 15 years.  So I'm on my 3rd one.  I decided last time to go with Jabra, had the Talk 65.  It looks the same as the Poly, on paper it seems slightly better, minus the UC support.  However, it's not even close to the Poly.  The main issue was the volume, just too quiet, and other bugs which drove me mad.  This Poly 5200 UC is worth every penny.  Switches so well between PC and smartphone, its clear, noise cancelling is miles better than the Jabra Talk 65 too.  Would highly recommend, and get it with the charging case, you won't regret it.

    Ich durfte das Set im Rahmen eines Produkttestes mal ausprobieren und hier sind meine Gedanken dazu:Grundsätzlich finde ich die gesamte Gestaltung des Headsets sehr elegant. Er sieht in schwarz mit roten Farbakzenten gut aus, wiegt nicht zu viel und fällt in der Tasche inkl. Ladebox nicht sehr ins Gewicht.Gefallen hat mir der relativ große Bewegungsraum der mir das Headset liefert. So muss ich manchmal in Besprechungen die Räume wechseln und bisher hat er mich da noch immer weiter verbunden gelassen. Die Akkulaufzeit reicht bisher locker für einen Vormittag ohne laden. Meistens hänge ich sie in der Mittagspause ans Netz und komme dann gut über den Tag. Hier wird es spannend sein, wie sich die Akkuleistung bei täglicher Nutzung über mehrere Monate verändert. Derzeit da aber kein Tadel. Die vorhandene Rauschunterdrückung finde ich in der Firma gerade mit Hintergrundgeräuschen sehr angenehm. Die Kopfhörer ließen sich auch ohne Probleme mit meiner Garmin Uhr, meinem Samsung Handy (jeweils mit Bluetooth) und dem HP Laptop (über Dongle) verbinden. Inwiefern es Einschränkungen mit Apple gibt, kann ich hier nicht einschätzen.Was mich tatsächlich aber etwas ärgert ist der Klang. Das Mikro, so ist die Rückmeldungen der anderen Besprechungsteilnehmer ist wohl gut verständlich aber für mich im Ohr kommen meine Gegenüber sehr blechern rüber. Ich telefoniere sonst mit den LG Tone und da ist der Sound besser. Hier ist natürlich viel Technik auf wenig Platz verbaut, was natürlich auch irgendwie untergebracht werden muss. Ich finde das einsetzen des Kopfhörer übers Ohr immer etwas aufwendig und ich muss genau kontrollieren ob er nun richtig sitzt. Auch finde ich ein USB-A Ladenschluss nicht mehr zeitgemäß. Das Laden ist vermutlich auch die größte Baustelle des Gerätes. In der beiliegenden Box klappt es ohne Probleme, sollte man jedoch mit der geschlossenen Box von außen laden wollen, muss man genau den Winkel treffen, dass das Gerät auch richtig lädt. Das sollte einfacher sein. Auch sind die kleinen, blauen Signalleuchten beim laden nicht immer wirklich ehrlich. Mal hat er angezeigt, alles voll und dann war's ratzfatz wieder leer. Also da gibt es noch Potential.Mein Resümee: ein ordentliches Headset für Konferenzen, jedoch gibt es bessere beim Klang und in der Handhabung

    I bought the Poly Voyager 5200 UC headset and I recived it six days ago.. But I am totally dissapointed to have my new headset defective. I got embarrassed during the management meetings as they were not able to hear me correctly while I am relying on reputable brand... They kept saying that your vocie is cutting.. First I thought it is an internet issue or laptop issue or .. or....It took me days to identify that the problem is from the headset itself and whenever I raise my arm or hand nearby the headset, my voice starts cutting.. I was not expecting such experience from Poly ( Plantronics ) itself!I opened a ticket with poly technical support, they told if you are wearing an eye glasses it could interfere.. !!  And asked me to do reset to the headset. Steps are as follows:
  








  
  
    . So I repeated the same test call with no eye glasses and same issue is still happening .. So disappointing!In addition to that issue. I returned the defective headset on Aug 10, and till today I havent received the refund !! I have been chasing Amazon throught tickets with no any result.... !!!

    Ich bin wirklich beeindruckt von diesem Headset. Die Audioqualität ist kristallklar, egal wo ich mich befinde – ob im Büro oder draußen.Die Verbindung ist super flexibel. Der mitgelieferte USB-A Bluetooth-Adapter ermöglicht mir eine Reichweite von über 10 Metern, und mein Mobiltelefon kann ich per Bluetooth 5.0 verbinden. Die Hinweise zur verbleibenden Sprechzeit und Verbindungsstatus sind praktisch.Das Design ist schlank und unauffällig, perfekt zum Mitnehmen. Und die Tatsache, dass es gegen Feuchtigkeit geschützt ist, macht es auch für den Einsatz im Freien ideal.Die Batterielaufzeit ist top. Der Akku hält den ganzen Tag während man es auch im Ohr hat.Besonders cool finde ich, dass es mit gängigen Videokonferenzplattformen wie Microsoft Teams und Zoom nahtlos funktioniert. Das spart Zeit und Nerven.Alles in allem bin ich sehr zufrieden. Dieses Headset hat sich als zuverlässiger Begleiter erwiesen, der meine Kommunikation problemlos macht und mir die Freiheit gibt, mich zu bewegen. Absolut empfehlenswert!

    Bisher habe ich über Jahre hinweg das PTL Legend genutzt. Auf der suche nach einen neuen Headset habe ich mir das Poly Voyager 5200 UC ausgesucht. Vom Daten her wirkte es für mich wie eine Weiterentwicklung vom PRL Legend.Positiv finde ich:- Das Ladecase. Das ist super. Schütz das Headset zuverlässig unterwegs, hat zweiten Ladekontakt, sodass ich das Headset auch schnell greifbar hinstellen kann und ist stets voll geladen. Großartig für unterwegs und im Büro.- Ich konnte meinen Gegenüber konnte ich stets gut verstehen, auch in lauteren Umgebungen findet man schnell die ""lauter-"" und ""leiser-"" Tasten und ändert die Einstellungen unkompliziert- Die Ansage, wer anruft. Kenne ich bereits vom PTL Legend. Ist weiterhin super praktisch.- Stimmiges Gesamtpaket: Headset, Case und Bluetoothdongle in einem Produkt- Tragekomfort, leicht und bequem. Auch bei längerem tragen keine Probleme. i.d.R vergisst man, dass man das Headset trägt.Enttäuscht hat mich:- das Hauptmerkmal eines Headsets, die Zuverlässigkeit wie mich mein gegenüber versteht. Hier wurde mir mehrfach gespiegelt, dass ich plötzlich nicht zu verstehen sei. Es klingt dann, als ob ich ganz weit weg  vom Handy sei. Die passierte sowohl im Büro (Verbindung per Bluetoothdongle) , als auch unterwegs (Verbindung per Bluetooth vom Handy). Hier half meist nur: Handy in die Hand nehmen und nicht mehr das Headset nutzen.Mein erstes Headset wurde (Amazon typisch) anstandslos getauscht, das zweite Gerät hat leider das selbe Problem. Geht nun auch zurück. Da trotz Werksreset, Softwareupdate vom Headset und verschiedener Gerätequellen (Telefonie per Handy und per Bluetoothdongle) dieser Fehler immer wieder auftritt, werde ich mir kein drittes Gerät kaufen und zurück zum PTL Legend kehren.Für dieses Gerät, aufgrund meiner persönlichen Erfahrungen, keine Kaufempfehlung.

    First and foremost, I did like this product when I bought it! However as time has passed (1 month) its got unreliable for example its comfortable to ware but it keeps slipping out of my ear which makes it  frustrating to use.Moreover, the biggest issue is the charging case when I got it first and charged it when it was fully charged the three led's were on solid for the case and head set to say it was fully charged this was ok for a few weeks but then I realized after charging one night that only 2 lights were solid for the case and the head set was the same as before I charged basically it did not charge this has happened good few times  its really difficult to know if it connected to the case and is poor quality! I purchased this and paid a high price expecting a quality built product now its so annoying I don't want to use it! This product is not worth the price paid!

    Avant d'acheter ce casque, j'ai posé une question qui n'apparaît surprenamment pas sur cette page. C'était : ""Bonjour, ce casque peut-il servir de simple micro (pour enregistrer un texte) ou de micro pour de la reconnaissance vocale (type Dragon ou Windows) ?"". Deux clients m'ont gentiment répondu qu'ils ne pensaient pas.J'ai quand même décidé d'essayer.Et là, je suis en train de dicter ce message avec mon micro-casque et la reconnaissance vocale Windows (qui ne vaut certes pas Dragon, mais ce n'est pas le même prix...).Donc, ça marche très bien ! ! ! :-)J'ai aussi fait un test sur Audacity. Cela enregistre parfaitement ma voix.Cela va donc m'éviter d'avoir un micro posé sur mon bureau ; sans compter que j'ai couplé le casque à mon mobile Android et que ça a l'air de fonctionner également (seulement testé ma messagerie pour l'instant).J'ai enlevé une étoile pour le confort parce qu'au bout d'un moment, ça me fait un peu mal à un cartilage de l'oreille, mais je sais que c'est un endroit sensible pour moi qui ai subi une opération.Je trouve que l'étui de chargement est très pratique ; en effet, il permet de ranger le casque de façon optimale et branché au PC, de charger le casque à la fois à l'intérieur ou en la posant dessus. Cet étui sert aussi de power bank pour 2 charges du casque.Il permet aussi d'écouter la radio ou de la musique en monaural ce qui m'arrange parce que je n'aime pas me couper de mon environnement.Donc, quelques heures après le déballage, je suis satisfaite de mon achat. Si besoin, je reviendrai compléter ce message.

    Headsets are not created equal, and I have four requirements that make a headset good:Comfort - while this one looks uncomfortable, it is actually quite pleasant to wear - with, or without, glasses. I wear this headset daily for at least five or six hours and I forget that I'm wearing it a half hour in. The rubber earpiece sits on your ear, not in your ear.Connectivity and range - This one has typical BT range when paired with a phone, but I get a good 50 to 60 feet (even through walls) when connected via the dongle. Pro tip - If you one of these and one of the Poly Voyager Focus headsets, then you can pair both with the same dongle and use the two headsets interchangeably by just turning power off on the one you're not using. Useful if you use the Focus at your desk and the 5200 when walking around.Sound quality - This isn't suited for listening to music for the noise reduction is outstanding and the sound on the ""other end"" is just like talking directly into the phone. Because it only fits on one ear, it doesn't reduce external noise for you (hence the Poly Focus), but the microphone does a great job in reducing outside noise. I have a habit of walking around the house when talking on the phone and sometimes walk over to the sink or microwave. The folks on the other side hear none of those distractions. For comparison, I also have a Jabra Talk 45 (also a decent set) but every distracting noise is heard on the other side.Charging and battery life - Battery life is realistically about 5 hours of talk time. This is actual talking/listening time, not ""powered on"" time, so unless you spend a lot of time on the phone, this should last all day. I generally charge mine every two days or so. Charging is a bit tricky. The battery base, as a concept, is great, but putting the headset into the cradle and making sure that it is in properly is a bit fiddly at times and the blue charging lights aren't very visible. Opening the case and placing the headset inside works far more reliably.As a gadget junkie, I have far more peripherals than I need, and this is one of the few that I'm not planning on upgrading.

    L'auricolare risulta un pochino ingombrante e non semplicissimo da indossare (soprattutto se si hanno gli occhiali)...però la qualità dell'audio è ineguagliabile sia ""in entrata"" che ""in uscita"" (così mi è stato detto dai miei interlocutori dall'altra parte del telefono!). Consigliato.

    Die Gesprächsqualität ist Standard. Der beworbene „Windshild“ ist TOP!Ich bin sehr viel auf meinem Pedelec unterwegs und brauchte ein Headset, was es mir ermöglicht, auch während der Fahrt, mit 20km/h und mehr, auch bei Gegenwind, zu Telefonieren. Das ist mit diesem Headset alles kein Problem. Verbindung zum Telefon, sofort, und ohne Probleme.Einzig die Musikwiedergabe kommt mit eines der Intelligenten Features in Konflikt. Diese wird, je nach dem wie gut der Sänger zu hören ist, lauter oder leiser. Ist der Sänger gut zu hören, wird die Hintergrundmusik nahezu rausgefiltert.  Führt dann dazu das man automatisch das Headset lauter stellt. Hört der Sänger aber mit dem Singen auf, ist die Musik brüllend laut und man muss wieder leiser machen. Man ist beim Musikhören also gut beschäftigt das Headset lauter oder leiser zu machen. Aber dafür ist ein Headset auch nicht gemacht. Das wofür es gebaut ist, nämlich zum Telefonieren, macht es super.

    My friend spoke highly of this product so I was excited to use it.Unfortunately, when using the USB attachment, there was lot's of static in the audio (my voice). Bluetooth worked much better, but it was disconnecting and sometimes I'd lose audio coming in and couldn't hear.Comparing this to my microphone I was using, this audio sounded much more up close, but not nearly as smooth. My co-workers said the sound was ""different"". So hard to say if it was better or worse.I had a blue yeti that I used for zoom calls, which I've now switched back to.

    Geräuschunterdrückung war sehr gut, Tonqualität ok, Verbindung mit Dongle stabil.Aberich musste das Headset jeden Morgen neu anmelden und teils auch unter tags erneut. Bis Mittag hat das Ohr trotz des geringen Gewichts des Headsets geschmerzt. Anrufe konnten am Headset gar nicht angenommen werden. Externe Anrufe, die über die Zentrale reinkamen, kamen überhaupt nicht auf dem Headset an. Und die Reichweite waren keine 10 Meter.Dafür ist es viel zu teuer, das kriegt man für weniger Geld teils besser.

    Bought this to call regular customers without picking up phone while driving truck. This feature rarely works properly, if at all. It states in blurb you have 7 hours of use, but when you switch on, it says ""6 hours"". It also claims to have a further 7 hours charge from the case but nomatter how long you leave it charging from case, when you switch it on again it'll say ""2 hours"" use (sometimes 1 hour). All told a very disappointing item for the princely sum of £110.00 especially when there are much cheaper items on the market. Would've returned it but the silly little dongle thing disappeared and is lost (no idea how, as I have been very careful with it) so I have had to put up with it.

    Das Poly Voyager 5200 UC hat mich aufgrund des Bügels neugierig gemacht. Wir haben zuhause noch ein älteres Headset der Firma Plantronics (wurde umbekannt in Poly), dieses hat aber keinen Ohrbügel. Dementsprechend wird das alte Headset im Ohr schnell unangenehm.Geliefert wird das Headset samt Ladeschale, einem kleinen USB-Dongle, zwei Aufsätzen für das Ohr sowie ein Ladekabel (USB-Micro) in einer einfachen Pappschachtel (der Umwelt zuliebe).Dieses neue Modell verspricht dem Abhilfe zu verschaffen - und das ganze funktioniert auch noch recht gut. Das Headset kann auch über mehrere Stunden bequem getragen werden. Der Ohrbügel kann dabei variabel verstellt werden über ein ""weiches"" Scharnier, also ohne Stufen. Das gefällt mir gut. Auch ist die Soundqualität recht ansprechend und dass man das Headset ""aufrecht"" in die Ladebox zum Laden legen kann (Box muss nicht aufgeklappt werden, im Deckel befindet sich eine Aussparung) empfinde ich als genial.Weniger genial ist USB-Micro zum Aufladen. Im Jahr 2023 empfinde ich das als veraltet. Wo ist hier USB-C? Auch wirkt die Ladeschale billig von Materialwahl und Verarbeitung. In das dünne, klapprige Scharnier habe ich kein großes Vertrauen für die Zukunft.Auch ist die Akkulaufzeit von ca. 5 Stunden (bei ca. 30% Lautstärke) über Bluetooth arg enttäuschend. Zudem hat das Mikrofon kein echtes Noise Cancelling, Störgeräusche bekommt hier der Gesprächspartner quasi voll mit. Je länger ich das Headset verwende, desto weniger gefällt es mir.Insgesamt kann ich das Produkt damit nur bedingt empfehlen (der Bügel gefällt mir gut), aber die vielen negativen Punkte führen dann zu Abwertung.Damit gibt es (noch) 3 von 5 Sterne.

    The sound and voice quality is great. However, the piece that goes behind your ear is quite bulky. It pushes the top of your ear out quite a bit.  It was challenging to wear both the earpiece and glasses at the same time…was very uncomfortable. We had to return them as they didn’t work out.

    Over the last 15 years, I've been a loyal Voyager fan (long before Poly and Voyager brands). Every 5 years or so, I would wear it out and buy a new one.Today, I had a totally different experience. The most recent purchase just wouldn't take a charge. Bummer first issue I've every had.So, I submitted a warranty claim. Within minutes it was processed and the tracking number for the replacement was sent along with instructions for returning the original.It was the smoothest, simplest Warranty experience EVER!Now I have a whole new reason to be a loyal customer :).

    Beruflich wie auch privat habe ich nach einem guten und ansprechendem Headset gesucht und bin hier beim Poly Voyager auch fündig geworden.Es ist sehr flexibel, lässt sich wirklich in alle Richtungen einstellen und ans Ohr anpassen.Man kann es natürlich rechts und links tragen und sich entsprechend ausrichten.Ein Ladekabel ist dabei sowie ein schützendes Hardcase, in das man das Headset bei Nichtgebrauch auch wirklich tun sollte. Dazu wie üblich eine Gebrauchsanweisung, die man aber nicht unbedingt braucht.Das Headset macht einen sehr edlen und ansehnlichen Eindruck, jedoch ist es relativ schwer bzw. muss man sich damit am Ohr erstmal gewöhnen. Bedenken habe ich nur, dass es bei schnellerer Bewegung etc. vielleicht auch mal aus dem Ohr fällt. Das dürfte natürlich nicht passieren, das werde ich aber noch testen.Einstellungen muss man nicht groß vornehmen. Das Set ist ziemlich selbsterklärend. Es lässt sich simpel mit Bluetooth über das Handy verbinden. Klang und Audioausgabe sind super, und für das Geld sollte das Poly Voyager schon was bieten. Das tut es auf jeden Fall und ich kann sagen, dass es durchaus ein cooles Teil ist. So ist es auch nicht zu klein, sodass man es nicht ständig verlegt.Alles in allem ein nützliches Gadget gerade auch für unterwegs und mit lauter Geräuschkulisse in der Umgebung.Ich kann es jedem, dem das ""Gewicht"" nichts ausmacht, auf jeden Fall empfehlen, aber das mit dem Gewicht ist auch emfindungssache.

    I honestly thought the haptics would be a gimmic but they really add a nice dimension. The sound has deep bass without sacrificing treble or being rumble and the sound has an overall warm tone. The mic is also one of the best headset microphones I’ve heard. Amazon asked me to rate the battery but these are wired so draw their power from usb.

    Para empezar los audífonos, salieron buenos, ya llevo 2 meses usándolos y son perfectos. Cabe aclarar que el paquete llegó bien, los audífonos son reconocidos por el programa de razer, así que todo está bien.-En cuanto al hypersense, tiene 3 fases y la ultima es bastante fuerte, a mi me da cosquillas en las orejas cuando está al máximo, al principio fue extraño, pero con el tiempo te acostumbras y te da mucha inmersión.-Los audífonos puedo usarlos largos periodos de tiempo y no me pican los oídos.-Debes tener cuidado, por que al tener puestos los audífonos, se bloquea todo el sonido del exterior, he tenido problemas con mis padres ya que tocan el timbre y golpean la puerta y yo no lo he escucho. en verdad bloquean mucho el ruido del exterior.-Tienen RGB y puedes configurar el color y como quieres que aparezca, aparte de que puedes modificar muchas cosas de sonido-El micrófono no están bueno, pero se defiende bastante bien.El único punto en contra es que la diadema no se es de regulamiento fijo y a veces se  baja de más por si sola.

    Dit is mijn 2e razer kraken, mijn 1e is een kraken TE en doet het nog geweldig.Deze besteld omdat ik toch nieuwsgierig was naar de hypersense, en ben positief verrast.De trillingen zijn leuk en voegen voor mij toch een meerwaarde aan het gamen.Alleen de oorkussens hadden iets groter mogen zijn, zeker omdat ik mijn andere kraken gewend ben die wat iets groter zijn en ook een verkoelend effect hebben.De microfoon kan ik niets over zeggen omdat ik deze niet gebruik, heb een aparte mic.Maar al bij al een goede headset en zeker voor die prijs(+/- 70€)

    After buying 2 turtle beach headsets that broke in the same place i decided to go for these, looking to avoid headsets with weak stanction supports above the ears these seemed pretty decent and solid, the amplification on these was a great match to turtle beach if not better and hopefully a solid construction aswell but only time will tell but defo worth the price, this was the wired version aswell, looking forward to putting it through the paces, updated review to follow in a few months.

    Great for audio, great microphone. LED lights are very pretty and can customise them.Only 2 downsides: occasional static noises that happen very rarely and cause is unknown and because the headset is heavy, after hours of wearing it makes my ears hurt.Recommend if you don’t use a headset for a long period of time.The hypersense feature is too much for me so I prefer not to use it.

    Commentaire en français et englishJ ai branché le casque, le son est bon quand les réglage dans le logiciel ssynapse est bon : les améliorations audio sont automatiquement réglé sur le mode ""jeu"" et donc en ""7.1"" ce qui pour certaines applications comme youtube ou autres applications audio/vidéo, cela donne un son pas super. Je conseille de le passer en mode manuel puis régler le type de son par application ( mode jeu, stéréo, film ... )Ensuite j avais remarqué un bruit bizarre redondant toutes les 2-3s dans l'écouteur gauche, cela est du au RGB lorsqu il est réglé de manière à ce que ça change de couleur, il faut soit le passer en statique soit le désactiver. Si ça peut aider des gens qui ont acheté le casque avec les mêmes soucis. Je mets 4 étoiles et non 5 pour ce dernier soucisI plugged in the headphones, the sound is good when the settings in the synapse software are good: the audio enhancements are automatically set to ""game"" mode and therefore to ""7.1"" which for certain applications such as youtube or other audio applications / video, it doesn't sound great. I advise to switch it to manual mode then adjust the type of sound by application (game mode, stereo, film ...)Then I noticed a weird redundant noise every 2-3s in the left earphone, this is due to the RGB when it is set so that it changes color, you have to either switch it to static or deactivate it. If it can help people who bought the helmet with the same problem. I put 4 stars and not 5 for this last concern

    C'est un très bon casque au prix de 80€ en filaire au moment de l'achat.Je l'ai pris une première fois en version sans fil, je vous le déconseil car malgrès se qui est annoncer, la charge ne tiens pas plus de 3 heures en mode hypersenses.De plus, toujours en version sans fil il y a des bugs de déconnexion (le casque s'éteint tout seul), parfois il n'y a pas de son nécessitant à reconnecté le dongle USB. Et pour finir le THX qui fait des siennes (blue screen, réinstallation car la sortie audio n'est pas sur le casque WTF ? etc...)Je l'ai donc repris en version cablé pour évité se genre de problèmes.Niveau confort rien à redire, il est super agréable à porter, la qualité du son avec le THX est très bonne, toutefois si vous désactivez le THX je vous conseil de bien mettre une EQ afin d'avoir un son potable.Le mode hypersenses ou ""vibrations"" est un peu gadget car je l'utilise surtout pour flex avec mes potes sur de la musique, en sois je l'utilise pas tant que sa car sur discord ou sur une vidéo/live a moins d'aimer l'ASMR sa n'a pas grand intérêt.Bref, il y a mieux comme casque mais vu qu'il a baissé de prix il est rentable.

    Toujours déçu par les casques Razer jusqu'alors, j'ai été très intrigué par cette technologie haptique. Et bien on peut dire que je ne suis pas déçu !Déjà, le casque est super confortable, même après plusieurs heures sur les oreilles, on le sent à peine. Le son est quand à lui très bon pour un casque de cette gamme de prix. Les aigus un peu en retrait, mais facilement corrigible avec l'égaliseur sur Synapse.Synapse qui par ailleurs est encore une fois ce qui pêche ici, le logiciel est une petite purge quand il s'y met, mais une fois qu'on a réussi à tout configurer, le casque garde tout en mémoire, plus besoin de s'en inquiéter. La spatialisation marche plutôt bien, ça fait plaisir de voir cette technologie enfin aboutir à des bons résultats.Pour finir, le petit gadget rigolo, l'Hypersense, ou le retour haptique dans les coussinets, avec trois niveaux d'intensité, qui peut être désactivé à la volée avec le bouton de l'écouteur droit, qui rajoute vraiment un peu d'immersion, notamment dans les jeux de tir, les oreilles qui vibre à chaque balle tirée ou qui vous siffle à côté de la tête, c'est très sympa ! On ne révolutionne pas le genre et on aura tendance à le désactiver quand on cherche à être compétitif, mais c'est un petit plus très sympa quand on veut s'immerger dans un jeu, voire même en écoutant de la musique !On est au final sur un casque de très bonne facture avec un rapport qualité prix très satisfaisant !

    Muy buena calidad de materiales, robusto, el sonido es realmente envolvente, muy conseguido, muy bien integrado con Windows gracias a Razer Synapse. Pero tienen un problema, al igual que al parecer otros modelos de Razer, y es que si conectas los cascos en un USB que esté al lado de otro que se esté utilizando, genera una estática en forma de pitido que molesta bastante, se nota sobre todo en los chats de voz de Discord o Teams entre otros.

    Die Entscheidung für dieses Headset erfolgte nach kurzer Recherche über Headsets mit haptischem Feedback (Vibration bei tiefen Tönen), wie es das ""Puma"" von ""Klim"" meiner Meinung nach sehr gut umgesetzt hat.Das Razer Kraken V3 Hypersense kommt nach Außen hin qualitativ hochwertig verarbeitet daher, mit hohem Tragekomfort. Die Bügel lassen sich je nach Kopfform über kleine Einrastmechanismen stabil und gut verstellen und die Muscheln schließen sehr gut um das Ohr herum ab, womit eine wesentliche akustische Abschirmung gelingt.Nach dem sämtliche Treiber und notwendigen Programme installiert waren, konnte ich leider schnell feststellen, dass etwas am Klang des Headsets nicht stimmt. Mit sämtlichen Einstellungen des Treiberprogrammes ein- oder ausgeschaltet, vom Minimum bis Maximum verändert ließen sich diverse Störgeräusche und Doppelungen nicht verhindern, im besten Fall nur verringern. Als Quelle dienten sowohl Youtube, Twitch-Streams (die einen ganz merkwürdigen Hall erzeugten), Musik-Portale und Audio-Quellen von der Festplatte.Das mit Abstand größte Manko, meiner Meinung nach, war allerdings das sog. ""haptische Feedback"".Es kommt in 4 Stufen daher (Aus, wenig, medium, stark) und lässt sich sowohl im Treiber, als auch am Headset selbst regeln, bzw. ausschalten.Sobald man diesen Modus aktiviert, überlagert der Ton komplett und wirkt stark verfälscht. Ich hatte fast den Eindruck, als wären in den Muscheln Teile lose und würden schnell hin- und hergeschleudert.Vom verfälschten Ton abgesehen, erinnerte mich die Vibration eher an ein Nintendo64-Rumble-Pack oder einen alten Playstation 4 Controller, welchen man sich an die Schläfe hält.Statt einer angenehmen Vibration, die zum Bass verstärkend wirkt, empfand ich dieses Feedback als plump und unangenehm umgesetzt. Das hatte das ""Puma"" der Firma ""Klim"" deutlich angenehmer umgesetzt.Mein Hauptaugenmerk für ein neues Headset lag auf dem haptischen Feedback, das nach meinem Empfinden nach nicht ansprechend umgesetzt wurde.Leider kann ich nicht sagen, ob es sich um einen technischen Mangel meines Produktes handelt oder die Produktlinie im Allgemeinen so funktioniert. Die Überlagerungen und Störgeräusche bei sämtlichen Audioquellen und Einsatzgebieten machen es mir allerdings unmöglich, für knapp 90 Euro ein Auge zu zudrücken.

    Ordered these to replace some many years old hyperx cloud 2's. Was intrigued by hypersense and wanted a headset to match my desk setup.On opening, this headset is beautifully made. They feel high quality, plenty of metal in the frame and plushness to the fabrics. Typical razer packaging, too.I was excited to try them thinking they would be a big improvement over a 7 year old headset and.... no, they aren't. Hypersense is fun in some games but in general web use its annoying as it gives a tinny reverb to the headset.The biggest issue is sound quality. They just aren't up to par with the Kingston made cloud 2's. The bass is muddy, mids and highs are just OK. Not good enough for a headset that cost more than double what I paid for my old battered headset 7 years ago. The soundstage is very poor. In COD, you can hear footsteps but have no idea where they are coming from. Spatial awareness is non-existant.THX spatial is a gimmick that adds nothing, pretty much like all software spatial post-processing. The 7.1 on my cloud 2s is trash and this is no better. Its something I'd never use.Connectivity options are poor, too. I knew this when buying the headset hoping the audio performance would be worth it, but it's simply not.Back for a refund it goes. And back to a kingston made cloud 2 I  go.

    Update: Es gibt ein Firmwareupdate für die Kopfhörer, dass schon lange draußen ist, ich aber nur durch Zufall gefunden habe. Seitdem finde ich laufen sie deutlich besser und ich würde jeden empfehlen es einzuspielen.Das Wichtigste zuerst, dass Headset ist, meiner Meinung nach zufriedenstellend.Tonqualität, sowie Mikro finde ich gut.Hypersense funktioniert und ist eine ziemlich nette Funktion (auch trotz Brille, entgegen anderer Bewertungen die ich hier gelesen habe).Negativ ist die Software. Irgendwie funktioniert sie nie richtig bei mir, was die THX Spatial Audio Einstellungen angeht.Die Standardeinstellungen waren ebenfalls nichts für mich, aber da habe ich dann im Internet einen guten Guide gefunden, mit dem ich den Equalizer in der Synapse Software auf für mich passende Werte geschraubt habe.Ein paar Bewertungen hier haben von ""fiepen"" oder Störgeräuschen gesprochen. Ersteres konnte ich nicht wahrnehmen, aber Störgeräusche kommen (sehr selten) tatsächlich vor. Mir persönlich macht das jetzt nicht aus, wenn mal kurz eine Interferenz Auftritt, aber das muss jeder für sich selbst wissen.

    After using Logitech for a long time and becoming frustrated with driver issues of the G-Hub software I decided to try Razer who are well advertised and reviewed. This is their latest headset for features and I prefer wired for reliability reasons so picked this up.The sound is okay if a bit bassy, build quality is decent and it's comfortable to wear, mic is neither the best, nor worst I used. Had so many issues with high pitched whistling and popping with the sound, if you watch a video and then close it then it makes a loud whistling sound for 10 seconds followed by a pop and it does this constantly while using them. Also it will randomly disconnect from USB and I need to take it out and plug it back in for my PC to recognise it. It's happened in multiple USB slots and nothing else disconnects like this so it's definitely the headset.This headset has this haptic nonsense that just makes the ear cups vibrate to the sound which is supposed to be more immersive in games but it just irritates me. If you like your ears vibrating constantly then good for you I guess. The Synapse software is no better than G-Hub and causes issues of it's own. Not very easy to use and lacks the options of G-Hub too when it comes to dialing in EQ and mic settings. I might just go back to Logitech.

    Ho avuto la possibilità di utilizzare le cuffie Razer Kraken V3 HyperSense per diverse settimane e sono rimasto estremamente soddisfatto del loro utilizzo. Innanzitutto, le cuffie sono realizzate con materiali di alta qualità e offrono un comfort eccezionale durante l'utilizzo prolungato. Ma è la tecnologia HyperSense che veramente rende le Razer Kraken V3 un prodotto di livello superiore.La tecnologia HyperSense fa vibrare i padiglioni in base alla forza dei bassi, creando un'esperienza di gioco estremamente immersiva. Questa funzione è particolarmente utile in giochi di guerra dove ci sono esplosioni, ma anche la musica è molto più coinvolgente con la vibrazione. Non è solo il gaming ad essere esaltato dalla tecnologia HyperSense: anche film e contenuti multimediali in generale sono resi ancora più appaganti.Le Razer Kraken V3 HyperSense sono disponibili in un'unica variante di colore: nero. Inoltre, le cuffie vengono fornite con un microfono rimovibile di alta qualità, il che le rende adatte anche per le chat vocali.In generale, consiglio vivamente le Razer Kraken V3 HyperSense a chiunque stia cercando le cuffie gaming più immersive in circolazione. Si tratta di un prodotto di alta qualità che mi ha soddisfatto pienamente e che mi sento di raccomandare. Lo valuto 5 stelle su 5.

    I added a Ferrite Bead to the cable...The static noise is less, it even picked up my phone signal every 5 minutes before...How is this CE certified? I certainly don't know. Measuring USB GND and comparing it to ground, a difference of 2.3mV can be noticed, higher than the 1.6mV my USB ports show on GND before, though I doubt that this plays a role.As for the CE certification, I did not open the headset as this would void warranty and wouldn't allow me to replace it, viewing a teardown though, inside there doesn't appear to be a Ferrite bead either.My tips to making this better would be:- Adding a ferrite bead near the USB plug and another one inside the headset, to ensure signal integrity.- If cable shielding is available, attach it to the ground on BOTH sides, to ensure proper static dischargeIn addition to that, these things - in my mind - should be changed too- If lights are active, there is a whistling arc noise on the left ear- The volume control adjusts too easily, a potentiometer would be better as well, as this adjusts PC volume, which can be annoying if you like to wear a sweater or hoodie or have long hair.I will say, the sound is great, yet it needs adjustment out of the box as bass is too loud and powerful, while higher and especially the mid-range frequencies disappear in bass. After this, these are great (for most sounds, turn of THX Spatial Audio after installing them with synapse!!! many people seem to forget this and complain about a sound that sounds like a empty can of soup, that is virtual spatial audio. That is just what it sounds like.I never found myself using THX. The vibration, haptic feedback is a fun to have, especially if you wanted to listen to your favorite electronic music, as the bass will shake your brain out for sure -w-In addition to all this... USB audio just never really is the best anyways. I will go for the more expensive version of these headphones now, as these have a 3.5mm jack too. The removable microphone is a big plus on this headset, too bad you can't use the microphone's 3.5mm port to attach the headset to a pc and detach the USB cable in this cheaper version...overall, it feels premium, quality seems decent to good, the ear cushions are nice to wear and they fit my head comfortably without high head pressure unlike some other headphones.After all this, these quality deficits however, are causing me to feel annoyed often. I can't listen to music without static noises every 2-10 minutes, especially with multi-layered sound aka when multiple instruments play at once, someone talks to you on discord while you are watching a video etc. this gets irritating. It also changes volume on it's own due to interference occasionally.These major downsides just don't make this a product I want to keep using, though it theoretically isn't 'broken', the interference and general issues with this lower the 'fun-value' of them quite a lot, so much in fact, that I lost interest in this model. I hope the bluetooth version with 3.5mm jack will be better.In addition to this, I hope this was just a manufacturing error and isn't actually the case for all products of this type. I am using Razer products since 8 years now, so far I haven't been disappointed with my old products but even my new keyboard seems to have issues with losing paint on the keycaps now through use over 8 months starting after 4. Sad Razer... Sad... Cheaped out in the wrong places.

    Ich bin mit Razer mittlerweile leider gar nicht mehr zufrieden. Die Qualität wirkt zwar erst immer sehr gut, ist aber mehr Schein als Sein.Insgesamt habe ich2019 das Razer Kraken 7.1 V2,2020 die Razer Basilisk MOBA und die Razer Oranata Chroma,2021 die Razer Basilisk X Hyperspeed,2022 das Razer Basilisk V3 und die Razer Kraken V3 Hypersensegekauft.Bis auf die beiden aus 2022 haben mittlerweile alle Probleme oder sind schlicht kaputt. Neben der schlechten Hardwarequalität kommt eine schlecht programmierte und fehlerhafte Software hinzu. Außerdem MUSS man Daten zwecks Kundenkonto preisgeben und die Nutzung überwachen lassen. Ein absoluten NoGo. Leider sitzt man etwas in der Falle, wenn man einmal Razer hat und die Geräte nicht zeitgleich kaputtgehen, immerhin soll ja eigentlich alles gleich aussehen.Das Razer Kraken V3 Hypersense habe ich als letztes Razergerät gekauft und damit hat Razer sich die letzte Chance verspielt. Das Headset ist in Ordnung. Es fühlt sich tragbar an, auch wenn die Ohrmuscheln deutlich besser und angenehmer bezogen sein könnten. Bislang löst es sich immerhin nicht ab. Schauen wir mal, wie es nach 1-2 Jahren aussieht. Die Tasten sind sinnvoll angebracht und das Headset selbst ist gut verarbeitet. Der Surroundsound ist durchschnittlich. Die Vibration ist ein ganz nettes Feature, allerdings gibt es eine gewisse Startschwelle, ab der es erst einsetzt. Das wirkt gekünstelt und nicht feinabgestimmt.Leider ist auch hier die Software wieder dürftig. Wie jeder durchschnittliche PC-Nutzer nutzt man ja nicht nur ausschließlich das Headset sondern auch normale Lautsprecher. Der Wechsel über Windows ist natürlich einfach, die Software reagiert aber nicht immer und das beworbene THX muss oft manuell gestartet werden oder Razersynapse neugestartet werden, damit es überhaupt reagiert. Hier ist auch wieder sehr schlecht gearbeitet worden. Mit der Software ist es ca. 50 € - 60 € wert und, wenn irgendwann einmal die Software korrigiert wird, dann sind wir bei 80 € - 90 €; 120 € ist definitiv zu viel, dafür müsste vernünftiges Kunstleder und eine austauschbare Ohrmuschel mit Sommermuschel mitgeliefert werden.Alles in Allem kann ich von Razer nur abraten. Die Qualität ist dem Preis nicht angemessen und Besserungen bei der Software lassen seit Jahren auf sich warten. Der Support ist nur eine Zusammenfassung der ersten beiden Googleergebnisse. Insofern sollte zur günstigeren Konkurrenz gegriffen werden, auch wenns dann ggf. nicht ganz einheitlich aussieht.

    Wahnsinn, wuchtige Bässe und die Vibrationen, man ist noch viel mehr im Spiel drin.

    Das Headset ist für den Preis ordentlich. Sound passt und bequem ist es auch. Das Haptische Feedback war bei mir aber leider das Retoure Kriterium. Im prinzip ist die Idee gut und es steigert doch sehr die Immersion, bei den richtigen Spielen und wenn Sie kein Brillenträger sind.Bei World of Tanks z.B., sobald man losfährt, fängt das Headset sehr stark an zu vibrieren, was in den ersten Sek. auch cool wirkt ist spätestens nach dem 4-5 Match nur noch anstrengend. Wohlgemerkt ich hatte es auf Stufe 1 von 3. Gibt man hingegen einen Schuss ab unterstüzt die Vibration schon sehr den Punch der Kanone. Bei dem ein oder anderem FPS Games hat man zu dem das Problem, das die Vibration nicht bei den Schüssen ausgelöst wird. Hier würde ich mir wünschen das man in der Software die Hz abfrage ändern könnte und alles ein bisschen feiner zu justieren. Auch als Brillenträger empfinde ich es nach einiger Zeit als sehr unangenehm weil mit dem Feedback die komplette Brille anfängt mit zu wackeln was doch auf dauer sehr unangenehm wird da vorallem die Pads auf der Nase extrem mitschwingen.

    Soy un gran usuario de auriculares. Tanto para escuchar musica, para ver películas o para juegos de ordenador.Razer nunca ha sido mi marca favorita de auriculares.

    Been waiting for the spare cash to buy these for ages after trying them in store. I LOVED the haptic tech (though not the best I've used) and was really happy at first...then I started getting constant crackling, static bursts and feedback which seems to possibly be picked up from my mobile (it happened every time I got a message). I made sure the software was all up to date and also reinstalled but nothing fixed it. As it's a work phone and I work at the same computer I game at I cant just yeet my phone elsewhere especially as I was also using these for work calls and meetings.... the exact situation I HAVE to have my mobile beside me. The noise cancellation is nowhere near what I have with my old Krakens, I could hear the sound of my basic circular floor fan when I was gaming which is just ridiculous, especially considering I regularly sleep through the noise of that on its mid setting when it stands two feet from my bed. It may be it's a frequency it struggles to block but it means it's just no good for me. Was gutted but made no sense to keep them so they were sent back for a refund.

    Si, tiene muchas cosas pero sorprendentemente no tienen algo que considero básico... y es una simple conexión Jack. Que unos cascos de más de 100 euros no tengan la conexión más apropiada para poder recibir la mejor calidad de sonido... dice mucho. De hecho, ocultan esta información en fotos, videos y descripción. A sí que nada. Ya para la próxima sabré que tengo que prestar atención a cosas que se suponen tan basicas como que tengan una conexión Jack!! Me parece ridículo la verdad.

    Ich habe das headset jetzt seit 8 Monaten und habe nur Probleme damit. Einfach alle Funktionen funktionieren auf der PlayStation nicht (4 wie 5). Bei der 4 muss ich das USB-Kabel öfters ein und ausstecken, um die volle Lautstärke zu erhalten. Bei der PlayStation 5 habe ich jede 15-20 min ein lautes Geräusch (ähnelt einem Krächzen bzw. Störgeräusch). Ich verstehe nicht wieso es diese Probleme hat, aber ich würde es nicht für die PlayStation empfehlen.Außerdem, wenn man Einstellungen über den PC auf das headset überträgt und es wieder in die PlayStation einsteckt, dann klappt es gar nicht mehr. Vielleicht hilft die Rezension dem ein oder deinem.

    There are mainly 2 problems with this product and I've replaced it once thinking it might have been a faulty headset but still have the same problem with the new one. First problem when plugged in I check my sound settings it comes up with two headphones for the same headset one called razor kraken v3 and THX spacial audio? I don't know which one to pick razor software tells be to make THX default but wen used it sounds like I'm being hacked by aliens or something horrible unable to use it then I use the razor kraken one and atleast I can hear things with this one and that leads me to the 2nd problem I keep getting crackling sounds? it's the reason I asked for a new pair thinking my first one might have been faulty but turns out even the new one has the same problem? Haptic is a really weird feature but one thing I can say if you are partially deaf like me (deaf in one ear) then I can help in a sort of way with the vibrations to the deaf ear not perfect but can help alittle. That being said I will be sending these headphone back aswell and looking for something different.

    Das beste Headset was ich je hatte!Sound und Ortung der Gegner ist on PointIn CS und Warzone sowie R6 kann man Gegner Punkt genau Orten.Der Klang ist auch echt gut.Das Mikrofon ist nur okay, aber da gibt es Möglichkeiten, habe einfach ein vmoda mic reingesteckt anstatt dem Standart mic ... Kostet nur 25 Euro.Gibt da auch noch bessere Varianten von Mod mic .. :)Ist easy einfach nur das normale austecken ist ja abnehmbar und das andere in die Buchse von Kopfhörer.Die RGB Beleuchtung ist auch ein Blickfang und gut synchronisierbar mit anderen Razer chroma GerätenIn meinem Fall das Gehäuse Maus Tastatur usw, funktioniert auch top!Hypersense ist ebenfalls eine tolle Sache aber eher ein Gimmick.Bei csgo etc ist es überflüssig, bei Story basierten spielen wie Far Cry 6 etc ist es aber nice to have und nutze es gerne.Der Preis ist zwar etwas hoch aber für das Gesamtpaket noch verschmerzbar

Grésille de manière aléatoire au bout de + - 10H d'utilisation NON STOP après l'avoir reçu.Micro de piètre qualité ... Impossible à paramétrer correctement sans logiciel tier.Bien loin des anciens razer kraken V2 niveau rapport qualité / prix.Le son est excellent (encore heureux pour du 7.1, anciennement 5.1 sur les Kraken V2), la réduction du bruit est excellente. Le contrôle du volume et les réglage du son entrant est correct.MAIS les grésillements après quelques heures d'utilisation en plus du microphone de mauvaises qualité en font l'un des pires casques pour 160€ !

    Grabbed these for the kids for Christmas. Microphone rarely ever works. The sound in headphones is seemingly fine after 24 hours. But the microphone works on and off and have wasted more time testing to get it to work then actually using it. Be lucky if there was a 5 minute period where it worked without issue.

    Los compré en poco más de 500 pesos, y el sonido me parece que es bastante bueno (aclaro, no soy un audiófilo). Son también bastante cómodos, abarcan toda la oreja y no me han cansado aunque, he de admitir, lo máximo que los he usado son como 3 horas seguidas. Tampoco me han acalorado, por lo que no ha sido necesario hacer alguna pausa para seguir usándolos.El micrófono es un plus, y me gustó que pudiera desprenderse para cuando no es necesario utilizarlo. La calidad del audio del micrófono también se me hace bastante buena.El cable tiene control de volumen y la opción para activar o desactivar el micrófono, lo que también se me hizo un muy buen añadido.El único contra que le encuentro, es que el cable se me hizo muy corto, por lo que tuve que comprarle una extensión de 70 pesos.Lo recomiendo si quieres unos audífonos de buena calidad sin gastar demasiado.

    I'm a HUGE fan of ""low-end"" turtle beach headsets, and I bought these to replace an aging pair of Ear Force PLa's that had served me faithfully for a long time (and still function very well, albeit thanks to a ton of tape work on damage I caused myself stupidly). Considering I paid only ten dollars more for these, the difference is staggering.As others note, they're not a top end headset, but for $40, do you really expect that? Sound is clear and crisp. Mic is clear and loud, without being overly sensitive (and the windscreen performs very well), and connects/disconnects easily... I'm actually using Dragon to type this with the mic in my laptops mic port! Some complain that the mic is inflexible, but I haven't found a position yet that it won't accept and stay with. I do, however, wish they had used the jacketing from the PLa line (ribbed, semi-metallic covering that allowed for total freedom of position) instead of the semi-hard, plastic-feeling overmold on this one.Leather-feel ear cups are VERY well designed and generously padded, they feel very natural on my head and surround my ear with an almost hermetic seal... pressing on the sides of the cups while wearing them yields a noticeable increase in pressure in my ears (you probably shouldn't do this).Entire system is very light (due in part to plastic construction, which doesn't come off feeling as ""cheap"" as other plastic headsets).At 4ft, the cord doesn't give a ton of room, but it was designed to be used with a console controller audio jack, so it doesn't need it... but for use with an mp3 player or laptop, it's great for those that don't need the extra length getting in the way.Some cons:In-line volume/mic control is small and hard to grasp (almost too smooth), and in turn, the volume control knob is very narrow and set deeply in the control box. When you do locate the volume blindly, it's somewhat difficult to roll, but I'm going to assume it will loosen in time. I would suggest moving it closer to the wire's splitter to make it easier to locate blindly, but it's a personal preference some may disagree with.The mic only inserts into the headset in one direction, having a cut out on the mic itself that must be aligned with a tab on the mic jack. It's difficult, though not impossible, to insert it while wearing the headset, so I suggest you choose in or out before you begin using them. I see no reason why this design had to be implemented, and hope future models will omit it.The connecting band has very little in the way of padding across the top of your head. It's not only a very small fill, but it's the same low density, very soft foam used in the ear cups, making it almost ineffective. It's not uncomfortable once you get the fit right for your head (though mine is shaved, your mileage may vary), but it still seems no thought at all went into this design point. Increasing the fill or using a higher density foam could fix this in future models.Each ear cup is connected to one half of the wire, which I personally don't enjoy the feel of, though its double connection design does prevent a lot of twisting that could lead to a single wire design pulling out of it's grommet. The wire(s) itself is very soft and flexible, which while offering comfort, I'm afraid would be easily abraded or pinched.All in all, you would be hard pressed to find another headset that offers more or performs better at or near this price point...it may even be an impossibility. Though PLa's are cheaper and more than adequate, for any looking for an entrance point into the headset market, these are without a doubt the only headset I will ever recommend again. If you need higher performance, just move up the price scale in the turtle beach line, each offering will blow you away.

    I always played video games with my old 5.1 home theater system, never failed me to produce a powerful, theater like experience . But I wanted to try a more ""competitive"" approach for multiplayer games. Been using them in COD Warzone, and I've noticeably got better. The headset really reduce outside noises, and with the right ingame audio settings, you can really hear enemy footsteps coming your way , doors opening and that's a game changer. I'm really impress with the audio quality, it's crisp and clear. The explosions sounds deep and impactful. The microphone is flexible and people hear me clearly on the other side.You just need to be careful with it. The plastic seems to be strong but could break with a bad fall. Here are my advises:1. Always place the headset on a flat surface/table, that way you won't knock it off and break it2. Disconnect the microphone when not used.3. Connect the microphone in the headset before putting it on your head...( the headset hole is deep inside and in an angle, it's a pain in the butt trying to connect it with the headset on your head, and you could bend the jack connector doing so. Trust me lol )4. Always disconnect the wire by gently pulling the jack plug and not by pulling the wire itself, that's the best way to damage the inner wires.Doing so will prolong the headset lifetime.All in all a really good headset for gamers!

    Cuffie economiche fatte in plastica leggera, in linea con la fascia di prezzo, ma non brutte e senza particolari problemi.Anzi! Una volta indossate (comode tra l'altro, almeno per chi come me ha orecchie piccole) sono rimasto quasi stupito dal modo in cui si riesce a localizzare la provenienza dei rumori nel gaming e dalla resa acustica in generale nella musica, con un suono che definirei molto educato.

    Heavily impessed with the quality even though a best buy rep had told me not to ""waste my money"" on this item, the cost to quality ratio is superb and the sound quality of video games are out outstandingly clear.Only thing that kind of bothers me (but can be fixed through some games audio options) is that the sound to communication volume is a tad heavy on the sound side rather then the voice side and your allies voice tends to get a tad drowned out.

    Après quelques jours de tests du casque.  POINT FORTLe casque reste un bon casque au point de vue qualité prix.Il est très bon au niveau son avec de bonne basse.Le micro est également top avec un anti-pop fournis.Il est aussi confortable et ne fait pas mal aux oreilles après quelques heures d’utilisation.  POINT FAIBLEJ'ai trouvé un seul point faible a ce casque ses qu'il me paraît un peu fragile au niveau du réglage de la tête.  CONCLUSIONCes un bon casque qui est parfait pour les gamers (normal) qui joue en ligne avec un bas prix.

    Ho utilizzato queste cuffie dal giorno che le ho comprate (Gennaio 2019) ed ho aspettato finché non ho ritenuto di averle utilizzare a sufficienza (forse anche un po' troppo) per fare questa recensione (come personalmente ritengo debba essere fatto prima di qualsiasi recensione).Venendo al prodotto, le Turtle Beach Recon 50P sono delle ottime cuffie entry level, la plastica dei materiali è di ottima fattura, il rivestimento dei padiglioni è in simil pelle anch'esso di buona fattura (a due anni di distanza sono ancora come uscite dallo scatolo, punto di merito anche il simil pelle che non si è crepato o staccato).Per quanto riguarda l'audio svolgono egregiamente il loro lavoro per il prezzo che costano, fluido, pulito, chiaro, sia in game che ascoltando musica o video la qualità resta la stessa, insonorizzazione quasi completa (se si indossano le cuffie è praticamente impossibile sentire qualsiasi rumore esterno, a meno che non arrivi una cannonata)Anche il microfono è di ottima fattura, l'audio in uscita è chiaro e pulito, non sgrana, e chi riceve non avrà fastidiosi problemi di eco o scricchiolio. Può essere rimosso  e riattaccato all'occorrenza, è regolabile e altra prova della buona qualità dei materiali anche a distanza di 2 anni il ferretto non ha perso elasticità o stabilità.Le uniche note di demerito a mio parere, che sono anche le cose che mi hanno dato più fastidio del prodotto, sono:- la lunghezza del cavo, che dall'attacco sotto i padiglioni fino al jack raggiunge il metro e venti (1.20) il che vuol dire che si ha scarso un metro di cavo, per qualcuno può andar bene, per me è un po' corto;- l'archetto che poggia sulla testa (si sarebbero potuti sforzare di mettere una spugnetta più spessa, essendo molto sottile alla lunga inizia a dar fastidio sulla testa e più volte mi trovo a dover cambiare la posizione delle cuffie perché perdo sensibilità dove poggiano) forse le hanno pensate per i capelloni, chi lo sa.- CONCLUSIONESono delle ottime cuffie per chi non ha troppe pretese ma non vuole rinunciare alla qualità, tra l'altro a questa fascia di prezzo.PRO- MATERIALI IN PLASTICA BUONI E RESISTENTI- AUDIO PULITO E CHIARO- MICROFONO REMOVIBILE CHE RESTITUISCE UN AUDIO PULITOCONTRO- CAVO TROPPO CORTO- ARCHETTO POGGIA TESTA TROPPO SOTTILE E SENZA UN SISTEMA DI COMFORT PER SESSIONI DI UTILIZZO PROLUNGATE

    Headsets are good but during summers and humid weather you tend to sweat a lot with the large headset. Voice quality is good due to the soft cushion provided with the speaker. Alternatively you can also go for high quality phone headsets. They are better for longer gaming hours.

    Ich muss sagen ich hatte vor diesem Headset eins für ca15€ und meine Team Kollegen hatte schon keine Lust mehr mich in eine Party zu holen da diese sich immer doppelt gehört hatten.Nach dem Tipp von einem Team Kollegen mir doch dieses Headset zu holen da es 1. günstig ist und es auch gemutet werden kann, überzeugte mich schon mal.Also bestellt und was soll ich noch schreiben.Kein Echo Hall mehr bei meinen mates, super Sound.Die Ohrmuscheln legen sich gut ums Ohr an.Der kopfbügel ( versteh nicht die anderen negativen Rezensionen ) liegt gut übern Kopf und hält auch.Es drückt nichts.Für meine spiel Gran Turismo Sport hätte ich mir lediglich ein längeres Kabel gewünscht das zum Controller geht, da ich den Controller neben mein Playseat erhöht liegen habe damit das Kabel nicht auf zu ist.Sonst kann ich es nur jedem empfehlen der eine 1.Klasse Headset haben will für etwas weniger Geld. Kein Rauschen oder sonstige Macken.Das Micro kann man ohne Probleme abstecken, durch den biegsamen schwanenhals kann das Micro vor oder neben den Mund gebogen werden und wieder zurück.Der Stecker vom Mirco hat eine kleine Nase bzw kerbe das man es genau einstecken kann somit ist auch für das Mirco ein guter halt.Also ich würde das Headset definitiv mir nochmal kaufenIch habe mir das Headset in Blau schwarz gekauft.

    Ho cercato nello store di Amazon delle cuffie per giocare alla ps4 dotate di microfono e desiderando un prodotto di buona fattura ad un prezzo acessibile ho deciso di comprare le turtle beach visto la fama del marchio. La costruzione interamente di plastica risulta ottima ed i padiglioni sono ben imbottiti e comodi anche dopo una lunga sessione di gioco. La qualità risulta nella media, buoni i bassi un pò meno gli alti ma mi aspettavo di più visto il prezzo e il brand. Il microfono funziona molto bene almeno a discapito delle persone che mi sentono in party ed ottimo il controller posto a metà filo per disattivare/attivare il microfono e regolare il volume. Da far notare che appena prese in gioco ogni tanto davano un disturbo che però dopo qualche giorno si è risolto da solo.Consiglio queste cuffie a chi non vuole rinunciare al marchio ma penso che a questo prezzo si possa fare qualcosa di più.

    Verarbeitung: Die Verarbeitung finde ich sehr hochwertig und schön (wie von Turtle Beach gewohnt). Etwas dickere Polsterung im Kopfbereich hätte nicht geschadet, aber insgesamt finde ich das Design gut, funktionell und auch relativ bequem. Mir gefällt vor allem, dass das Headset sehr leicht ist und nicht auf den Ohren drückt. Einzig allein das Rausziehbare Mikro hätte man vllt. etwas anders verbauen können.Klang: Gekauft habe ich das Headset hauptsächlich um Nachts Dead by Daylight zu spielen, um dabei sowohl räumlich hören zu können, als auch mein Umfeld nicht beim schlafen zu stören.Der Klang ist relativ sauber, man hört aus welcher Richtung Geräusche kommen und insgesamt ist die Lautstärke gut ausbalanciert, ABER insgesamt für meinen Geschmack ein wenig zu leise, was jedoch meiner Meinung nach bei Overear Headsets in dieser Preisklasse nur schwer zu vermeiden ist.Ich kann meine Teammates über die Playstation Party gut verstehen und mir wurde gesagt, dass das Mikro auf der anderen Seite der Leitung einen sehr klaren Klang liefert.Neben der relativ leisen Lautstärke lässt noch der Bass zu wünschen übrig, aber insgesamt ist der Sound für mich ok.Alles in Einem kann ich dieses Headset jedem empfehlen, der nicht permanent damit zockt, sondern nur hin und wieder/bei bestimmten Spielen. Das Preis/Leistungs-Verhältnis ist okay, wem das Design gefällt kann ohne schlechtes gewissen zuschlagen.

    Antes de escribir mi reseña he vuelto a leer toda la descripcion y preguntas realizadas y en ningun apartado encuentro que hace falta un split para conectar auricular y micro a tu ordenador para poder tener a la vez sonido y micro. La verdad que los cascos son ligeros y comodos, con una estetica bastante bonita. ¿El problema? Que o los conecto a la salida de auriculares o a la salida de microfono, por lo que no puedo tener ambas opciones conectadas a la vez. Tienes que leerte el manual que trae incluido para darte cuenta que hace falta si o si este adaptador. Te remiten a la pagina del fabricante para comprarlos y cuando accedes ves que cuestan 10 EUROS. ¿Como me van a vender un adaptador de jack por 10 euros si los cascos enteros cuestan 20? No tiene ningun sentido. Es un abuso. Estoy buscando online a ver si en algun sitio se vende alguno generico que pueda usar por 2 o 3 euros, pero tiene que tener la entrada hembra y las 2 salidas machos y todos los que veo son al contrario.Resumen, buenos cascos en relacion calidad precio pero ojo, si buscais que nada mas os llegue tengais micro y audio en vuestro pc, estos cascos no son para vosotros. Por 30 euros habra cascos mejores que lo traigan ya todo preparado.

    Dopo 7 anni di XO One era giunto il momento di sostituirle, anche se non potevo fare a meno di notare che la TB nel frattempo aveva notevolmente abbassato la qualità dei suoi prodotti di fascia economica. Prima di approdare a queste 50P ho provato diversi modelli della serie 70 e TUTTI mi hanno dato dolori a orecchie e testa dopo nemmeno 40 minuti di utilizzo. A parità di prezzo, queste sono di un altro pianeta, letteralmente: un po' di fastidio lo si comincia ad accusare dopo un paio d'ore ma non è niente che una buona pausa non possa risolvere. In più, il fatto di poter rimuovere il microfono (e non semplicemente spostarlo all'insù come nelle 70) rappresenta un plus che ormai è sempre più raro in questa fascia di cuffie. Il suono, come sempre, è ottimo e ben bilanciato, quindi 5 stelle sono d'obbligo.

    Best headset under 2000.Pros:Sound is good enough, and the microphone is great for a budget headset. The ear cushion are comfortable enough.Cons:The cushion on the band for you head is super thin, its pretty much there for show so wearing it for long periods does hurt your head. Infact wearing it for even 10 mins makes your head hurt.I have to constantly adjust it as it hurts the top part of my head.Wish the headset extension was a bit longer as I have to wear it at its fullest extent. Its built more for children or someone with a tiny head.If you are on a budget and are looking for a branded and renowned gaming headset manufacturer,then buy it. You can always get a better one but this is fine if it's your first haedset.I like the headset a lot but I only wish it had more padding on top. This should be a thing to consider which I unfortunately did not.

    First of all Products packaging was good. Came in a rather large box, but contents were protected.It also came  with the basic manual etc. Gave this a 3 star review as this headset was recommended by a gamer friend who had purchased one of the later models and had suggested it as a good option for a remote job.Sound QualityThe first five months of using the product went fairly well. Audio can be turned up very loudly, but if there is background noise the person on the other end will hear it. There is a manual mute botton and volume enhancer botton, but the persons on the other end will hear the odd silence when you press it.FitThe fit was pretty good, fits the ears really well. The ear muffs are very big, comfy and round. (As mentioned, before, noise still gets through).  Disadvantage, after about 6 months the mock leather on the ear muffs will begin to strip a bit. The headset  overall has a pretty big fit, so if you have a small-medium head you may have to readjust a few times. If you have a big head head (tee-hee!), you'll like it. Plus it has a rigid lengthening options on both ears. The muffs themselves have a bit of pivot in them, but the headband (that rests on top of the head) is made of hard plastic and can break if not treated with care.Issues I had:1. The cord or the point that connects into the computer (3.5 mm jack), under six months started to lose static, then over time it stopped working. (Have lighted the part in  on the headset that gives trouble overtime). You can hear videos if you turn it the right way, but others won't hear you clearly, until one day you completely lose the static. Overall was disappointed in the headset as I expected more from a $25 headset.2. We tried to get another jack but those efforts failed, hence the end is cut off in the photos.

    The Mic sound is pretty good for a cheap headset like this one. The sound is ok but you'll be able to hear footsteps, etc in games. I wouldn't buy this because within a week of using the headset I tried using my mic and it picked up no voice. I unmuted my mic and still no voice. I went on my laptop and went to an online voice recorder and it worked but not on my ps4 which was weird. I realized that the online voice recorder would still capture my voice even though I switched my mic to mute so I am guessing right now that the flip switch is hard stuck on mute for some reason and that's the reason it would pick up my voice. Anyways instead of these, I would rather go with the Turtle Beach Recon 70s.

    These are the best earpiece I’ve come across.  The noise cancelling is excellent, people have often expressed surprise that I’m in the car doing 100km/hr and not sitting at my office desk. Battery lasts for a full day of phone calls and it’s very comfortable to use.  I’ve abandoned my useless in-car Bluetooth and just rely on the 5200.  I’ve paired my laptop with it as well and do all the Zoom and Teams meetings with superb voice clarity.  Highly recommended for the phone user on the go!!

    My previous Plantronics earpiece had no over-ear attachment (it just pushed into/held in your ear on its own), so was easy to pick up, remove it from it's little charger coffin, and put in your ear and the battery charge lasted for ages (so did the device, but all things die in the end). This thing has me pissing around every time to try and fit it to take/make a call, constant bluetooth connection drop-outs, and crap battery. to add insult to injury, the third party charging case for it died in just a couple of months.

    Have replaced plantronics voyager 5200 Poly 3times due to it fading out and in. I'm not sure if it's the noise cancelling that's thinking my voice that is background noise. I'm on to my 4th Bluetooth and looking to send back to get a refund and looking for a new Bluetooth. I should say the plantronics voyager 5200 I never had a issue before always was a great Bluetooth but something thing is clearly wrong with this model. Maybe a bad batch for 2023🤷🏼‍♀️

    Still the best earpiece for daily use, earbuds can't replace the utility.Pros- hands free answering and/or rejecting a call- light on the ear, sits on the surface so ambient sounds are natural- loud and clear when outdoors or in a crowd- Multipoint- press the button with not on a call and it'll tell you how much talk-time is left and which devices its currently connected withcons- boom is a bit long- still uses micro-usb- doesn't have NFC (i'm fine with that)

    I have used so many TWS, including the ones from Apple and Google. Although they are great at sound and music, use them to make a call from an Indian Road, and be ready to irritate everyone else.This is a one stop solution for professional calls. It is almost magical in its ability to wind down environment noises.Not perfect. Switching between laptop and phone can be improved. I had the bt700 dongle for laptop from the focus 2. It really makes connection to laptop perfect.They don't have the option to buy the charger stand and dongle. It makes sense to have them. Charging port looks flimsy. Certainly don't use the provided cable as it is very poor quality and will end up harming the ear piece.Also the earbuds could be better.But what it offers in terms of ENC, this product has NO competitor. No one comes close.

    1～2年ごとに買い替えながら計5～6台Voyager Legendを使い続けていた。Legendは着信音は耳から聞こえるのに通話ボタンを押すと声が聞こえず、通話はスマホ本体の方に切り替わっているという誤作動が時々あった。使ってきた全ての個体で発生していたので、個体差ではない。装着センサーの誤作動か？5200の方は今のところその症状はない。ただし音楽やラジコを聴こうとすると、ほぼ毎回スマホ本体から音が出始めてビックリする。5200の電源を入れ直したり通話ボタンを押してもダメ。スマホのBluetoothをOff/Onしてもダメ。色々試したが、ペアリングをしなおすとつながる事が分かった。ラジコを聴くたびにこんな事をしなくちゃいけない。性能や通話音質は文句ないので、もう機能を増やしたりしなくていい。動作の安定・信頼性の向上に努めてほしい。

    Had bought the same product in 2017 (battery life ran out after extensive usage in 2022 - 5 years is fair) for around ₹ 22k when it was still Plantronics that had not yet taken over Poly.com (Polycomm) & found it to be beyond words in terms of quality & features. Got the same product now in 2023 obviously expecting the same quality but this time it was called Poly (Plantronics had taken over Poly & now Poly merged with HP) but found it lacking in various aspectsCons - tech:(1) The battery is supposed to be 7 hours but doesn't go beyond 5 hours of charging.(1.1) Battery actually doesn't even last the 5 hours, every time you shut it off and switch it on even when on standby it generally eats away one hour.(2) It will disconnect between calls and reconnect at will.(3) The voice announcements are not just different from what it was but that's negligible but it doesn't always announce names that it used to earlier while my address book remains the same.(3.1) Earlier it used to announce aka read out numbers of callers that aren't in address book but now that feature is absent keeping you guessing or take a look at the phone.Cons - Company / Organisation1. While the build quality seems better than the earlier one which is a pro; HP subjects the customer to their elaborate processes such as1.1. Clicking pics of product and sending them1.2. You have to print the original invoice to send it back with the courier for pick up.1.3. You have to write on the box the serial number and all identification data on the box.1.4. Person talking to you on mail is from HP while the one on phone is generally Poly (cause the transition is still ongoing in the merger).1.5. The logistics department is blissfully unaware and cut off from the communication and they wind up calling you not knowing head from tail.2. They did send a replacement of the original PLT one (inspite of me asking them if the battery will hold good since PLT series was renamed Poly in 2018 and it's battery only lasts 5 years) when I logged a complaint  but again what I anticipated came to pass as the battery was drained in the replacement earpiece no matter how much you charge the standby time was only 5 minutes.3. Customer is subject to the lengthy organisational documentation processes laid down by HP that is cumbersome.3.1. This wouldn't happen even after Plantronics took over Poly where I remember the earbud that is a separate movable part had broken up and I tried reaching Plantronics / Poly, India who didn't respond to several calls and mails; I randomly wrote a stinker to their UK office and next thing is I received 2 sets of earbuds.PROS - Tech1. Sound quality is excellent2. Noise cancellation is awesome as ever3. Siri works fine as does AlexaPROS - Company / Organisation1. The CSE are exceptionally prompt.2. They do their best within scope of their knowledge & laid down processes.3. They keep following up religiously till the case is closed (in my case I gave up and requested them to shut the case as I didn't have time to keep going in circles, wait for their tech R&D etc)On the whole the product is still good BUT difference in the ₹ 22k and ₹ 8k product can be felt by those that have used it earlier.

    3回目の購入です。他社の製品も使用しましたが、結局はこの製品が使いやすいので、リピート購入しています。以下、参考まで。★良いところ•マイクが高性能のようで、通話相手からの評判が良い•一度ペアリンクをしておけば、イヤホンをONにした際に、ほぼ確実に自動接続してくれる•音量調整、通話受け、曲飛ばしをイヤホン側で操作できる•寝る時以外は装着しているが、全く違和感なく装着できる★残念なところ•電池持ちは、YYK-525の方がよい•音質に関しては、ELECOMのHSC20のほうが良い•頻繁に使用していると1年ほどでガタが来る

I wish you could just have cute things that work. I'm honestly willing to forgo quality for some cute headsets but these just stop working properly after a while. I've had two pairs, the first one died after 5 months and I thought it was cause i got a faulty pair. My second one started doing the same, no audio, mic muting randomly too. I've just contacted razer but honestly save yourself the hassle.

Okay here's the quick review. Sounds great. Is comfy (used to stream for over 12 hour sessions). Would recommend alone for quality. But Twitch Integration simply doesn't work.Now for the depth of it. I'm using OBS and StreamElements on Windows 10. I've linked Razer Synapse and Companion App and all that jazz to Twitch. Test Alerts work fine. In actual practice, nothing. I am not switching to OBS Streamlabs to use the headset either - and especially not now after everything has come to light, which frankly, doesn't surprise me. I digress.The sound is great, I was previously using a Razer Man O'War Edition, and the sound is better (but could easily be due to degradation over time).The comfort is a 10 for me, the ear cups don't squish my earlobes whilst wearing them - many headsets have in the past so this is a real plus.The RGB is bright and vibrant but depends on your lighting setup, obviously. I just use Razer Synapse Chroma Visualizer for some effect rather than static. But half the reason I bought this headset was to use with Twitch.My only concern with the Krakens is the cable being exposed above the earcups and between the top headrest is showing.**I have contacted Razer on Twitter and they just responded with a help bot/somebody who had no idea what I was talking about with Twitch Integration. So customer support gets a 4/10 for atleast acknowleding my existence and trying to help - even if linking to the same webpages I used to set up the device.**My only hope is that this whole Streamlabs OBS thing maybe kicks Razer to update the Companion App, unlikely. I just don't understand why Twitch Alerts work in Preview and not while Live - could just be a StreamElements issue which I haven't contacted them about yet.

    the audio and mic quality are nice, but the cord is frail. my cord died within 12 months and razer sent me a replacement product, however the second pairs cord died within 6 months so i gave up and just bought a different set. if you want the aesthetic go for it, but just be careful of the cord and try not to get it twisted

    The sound quality is honestly pretty amazing, and the comfort is great for maybe 1-1.5 hours but then my ears got really hot.The pricing is pretty good but I would suggest getting the regular kraken if your not looking for the aesthetic cause I mainly got it cause it looked cute.Overall, good sound quality, good comfort for shorter periods, and very aesthetic! Would recommend if your into the aesthetic but the regular kraken will be just as good!

    The design of this headset is quite cute and I love it, sound quality wise is good too. There's a button behind the headset close to where the volume scroller is, which I assume is the 3D sound function. If you leave that on, the sound is bound to disconnect after. On top of that, this is the second month I'm using this headset, not even two months in and there are some connectivity issues, where the sound and the mic cuts off. At the start, I had some issues with it too and had to restart my PC for it to work. For the price I paid, I was expecting something that's of a higer quality. I have read some bad reviews about this on Amazon but there were a lot of good ones too. I decided to give it a go and I'm kind of disappointed in the quality of this headset. I had a Logitech G432 headset before this, I was using it for more than two and a half years, I also acciddentally dropped it before and it still works perfectly fine despite the design looking flimsy. I never had any issues with that headset either. This one? The build makes it look like the quality is good, but in reality is way worse than the Logitech headset I had, I had to deal with more issues and way more expensive too.

    I bought this headset to replace an my old pair of headphones, and am very happy with the headphone functionality. However, the RGB functions did take some setting up to get working properly, and do not work as seamlessly as other RGB devices I have used. Additionally, while programming RGB, I noticed that Soft color tones can be hard to see, and I had to make them brighter so I could actually see them. Other than that, they're pink cat-girl headphones, what more do you want?

    Really great sound, especially when you go into the Razer Synapse software and pick the right settings. The mic is not that great but doesn't pick up background noise which is good.Now the reason I'm returning it - I have a small head and I've been using an older Razer Kraken Pro V2 which has thicker ear cushions, which cup around the sides of my head and kind of hold the headset up and distribute the weight of it evenly. The Razer Kraken Kitty for me, basically just sat at the top of my head. The sides were way too loose and didn't really cup around my ears, so I would just get headaches on the top of my head after 5 minutes of wear, which sucked. If you've got a small head like me, I don't recommend this headset!! You'll get headaches :(

    I got this for my birthday, which is also my own fault because I didn’t really read reviews, but I’d have high hopes because it was so darn expensive?! I took care of the headset really well in comparison to my older ones. But they both seemed to have fully cut out within 6 months? Really weird, sucks considering I paid $250, the quality of the sound and the comfort is still pretty good though.

    I got these as an early Christmas present from my partner and I love them a lot!These are definitely well made for gaming; I can hear footsteps and shots so well in these, and it increases game immersion.The sound quality is surreal, and you can adjust the mode from Stereo to Surround Sound for specific apps and games in Synapse. You also can control the volume from the little wheel on the back, and the volume range is super powerful while maintaining the sound quality. Another pro is that they're noise cancelling. I would even wear these on the street while connected to my phone with a USB to Type C adapter; they don't feel too heavy on the head and you can maintain the light mode with cosplay mode. Also, they don't squish your head with prolonged use, and, because I wear glasses, this is definitely a major pro.Upon testing it on Speech Jammer, the microphone is the clearest I've ever used. You can definitely use it even for live streaming and YouTube voice-overs. It also features a mute button right at the tip, and lights red when active.I love using the Chroma Studio to customise the lights on the ears and sides, so it elongates the experience in a way.And, if it wasn't obvious already, they are absolutely adorable and taking selfies with these, as shallow as that sounds, is a joy!

    The headset sound quality and the mic sound are superb and build is sleek and cute at the same time. The retractable mic is a plus, it doesn’t get in the way when not in use. It is also comfortable to use compared to a lower end headset I bought 2 months ago. I am happy with my black Razer Kraken Kitty despite of being on the pricier side. I hope it last a long time.I’d love to give this a 5 star review but I had an issue connecting it. The device worked perfectly with a new RSH 7 Port USB 3 hub with AC Adapter I bought on the first night. However, the next day it keeps getting disconnected and reconnected in Razer Synapse 3. I tried some TS steps online and it seems like it happened to other users too. I made sure all apps/software were updated and restarted several times to no avail. Now, just to use it I connect it directly to may laptop even though I prefer it attached to the hub with other accessories. I will try it again some other time and hopefully it works again on the hub.

    Actualmente tengo varios headset, unos sennheiser HD 598 Cs,  un razer tournament manowar, hyperx cloud alpha y el headset de dva (incluso tuve unos beats solo 2).  De todos estos la comodidad se los han llevado los Kitty. Uso lentes de armazón delgado y tengo perforadas mis orejas así que desde el inicio se siente la diferencia (pondría mis sennheiser en empate y los cloud alpha en segundo lugar).En cuanto a sonido la verdad me parecieron muy buenos,no me desagradan los bajos potenciados (los disfruté en mis beats solo2) pero este headset no exagera en ellos, siento que tienen muy buen balance. Los probé en overwatch y el positional audio está muy bien, recordando que para juegos no es necesario tener el surround.En cuanto al micrófono la cancelación activa me pareció buena (aún sin moverle a los settings) , ya he comparado los otros en overwatch y estos sí tienen un pequeño plus.  Probé hablando con otra persona y la otra persona sí se oía con un volumen más bajo que mis demás headset con mic.En cuanto a calidad de construcción se sienten súper bien, no tengo miedo de que se rompan como mis manowar TE. Y al parecer estas almohadillas van a durar más que las de los manowar.La verdad es que el RGB y las orejas no eran tan necesarias para mí, pero no quería algo tan parecido a lo que ya tengo y no era tanta la diferencia en precio comparado con los razer kraken ultimate (que técnicamente son lo mismo). Aún así me está gustando mucho el detallito de las luces con mi música.Espero poder hacer update positivo de este headset después de usarlos por un rato :)  pero de entrada me encantaron muchísimo.

    Depois de 1 ano de uso, venho aqui deixar minhas observações. O fone é lindo e o software da raze sempre atualiza. Depois de um curto tempo de uso, comecei a perceber que o microfone não tem qualidade, minha voz sai bem rouca e “suja”, todos sempre comentam, para o valor, esperava mais da qualidade do microfone. Já o áudio é perfeito, e tem diversas opções no software para alterar. Com o tempo o cabo começou a enrolar e meio que partiu bem na altura do pescoço e fica me dando choque. Se você está procurando por um headset gamer com qualidade de matéria e microfone não recomendo a compra desse. Mas se for para apenas áudio ele é sensacional!

    The Pulse 3D Headset for PlayStation 5 is a great product for gamers who are looking for a high-quality, immersive gaming experience. The headset is designed specifically for use with the PlayStation 5 and provides a number of features that enhance the gaming experience.One of the things I liked most about this headset is its comfortable design. The ear cups and headband are made with soft, breathable materials that make it easy to wear for extended gaming sessions. The headset is also very lightweight and you can wear it for hours and not feel any discomfort.The sound quality of the headset is also great, the 3D audio feature provides a more immersive gaming experience, and you can hear every sound in the game with great clarity, it provides an immersive experience that is hard to get with other headsets.Another thing I liked is that it has a built-in microphone which is very clear and easy to use, making it perfect for online gaming and communication with friends.The only downside I found is that the headset is a bit pricey, but it is definitely worth the money for the high-quality, immersive gaming experience it provides.

    Frustrating that I can’t just use my AirPod Max with the PS5 just like I do with every other gaming device, so I had to get these. Going from a decent set of headphones to these is noticeable, the fit isn’t adjustable so it can feel like the headphones are floating on your head, they are not fully closed, so you can easily head surrounding noise, the 3D sound is pretty good though. It really feels like the headphones were such an afterthought for Sony when they made the PS5.

    The seamless integration with the PS5 console is a big selling point. Built and sound quality are also above average. The only issue I have is the tension of the headband. It clenched my jaw and made usage uncomfortable after more than half an hour. I ended up removing the rubber headband and attach a household sponge to keep the headphone on top of my head. Much more comfortable this way, but looks rather ugly.

    I'd been using an Arctis 7 for both my PC and PS5 and it was a pain swapping the bluetooth dongle between the two so bought the Pulse headset to be my committed PS5 headset. The first time I jumped into a voice chat with some friends, unprompted and with no knowledge that I'd replaced my headset, my buddy Steve says ""Eurgh, why do you sound so bad? What did you change?"". A day later I have an almost identical discussion with my friend Dave, who asks what happened to my headset and why I sound so much worse. Hardly a ringing endorsement, and made me feel like I should have spent a little bit more money for something better.The controls on the headset are pretty good, I appreciate being able to easily hear the side-tone (hear my own voice back through the headset) and easily adjust the game/chat balance. I think generally the game audio I'm hearing is solid, and the headset is light and comfortable. I have quite a big head and large ears (my head has the same proportions as a lightbulb lol), but the cups cover them and the headset is fine to wear for extended periods of time without feeling like my head is being squished. Just be aware that the mic isn't the best, and if you're swapping from a Steelseries or Razer headset then this is probably going to be quite a big step down. Also worth noting that the battery life seems to match the PS5 controllers (it's bad) and I've had to recharge the headset multiple times even though I've only had it for a week.

    This headset is easy to connect and setup. Can be used on multiple devices not just the ps5.The audio quality is excellent and i cant find a fault.Battery life is also rather good. Lasts easily 5 hours without a charge.My only grievance would be the ear cups are slightly uncomfortable. The leather feel may make you sweat in warmer locations. They are soft and fit a large ear easily.

    Likes, sound quality is the same as my Astro A50’s but noise canceling is better than my A50’s though they only have the std ear pads. I do like the sliding adjustable head strap that’s a cool innovation, the usability on other devices is a bonus plug and listen though a Bluetooth option would of been a nice touch also great design.Dislikes, somewhat tight fitting people with a bigger than std head ears get little uncomfortable after hours of gaming but not to the point where I need to remove the headset, guess more usage will help stretch the main frame , to scared to try and  do it by hand in case I snap them hahaha.All in all I still recommend them to anyone wanting very affordable headset equal to myA50’s for a fraction of the price, sorry Astro I still use my Astro A50’s also

    Very limited stock floating around meant I felt pretty lucky to be able to get the headset when it became available, and haven't been disappointed with it since. It looks great alongside the PS5 and the other accessories (controller, charger, remote) and the quality of the sound is high. The noise cancelling really elevates above previous headsets I've used.Only downside is that the design does feel very flimsy and fragile and it remains to be seen how durable they will be with the heavy use I intend for them!Great price and delivered very quickly. Several days earlier than originally estimated by Amazon at checkout.

    This headset is objectively amazing. The comfort, built quality and style are fantastic and feel premium. Yes, it’s a wired headset and can only be connected via 3.5mm jack but the sound is incredible (punchy and rumbling yet also detailed bass and clear highs). The mic sounds fantastic too (I sound rich and natural) and it is both flip to mute and detachable. There aren’t any controls on this headset other than the volume wheel, but what it lacks in features, it makes up for with comfort and sound quality. Highly recommend

    Throughout my time I’ve purchased MANY headphones, I am very very picky with how they perform and feel and the quality of the headphones itself.. now the reason I’ve gotten this was cause my last pair were decent but the wire gave out sadly… i did the switch to the epos based on what I’ve heard about them and my oh my where have I been. These headphones not only feel nice and look good but they also sound spectacular and have some very nice features. For one the open back models have absurd surround sound which trumped a lot of headphones with surround sound I had before, the audio clarity is great and the headset feels very comfortable for long durations of gaming or music or whatever you do. One fantastic feature i love is the option to take off the mic if you have one too, and the slick little disk that covers it is another part of that which I love.Overall, quality and performance for audio on these headphones are very good and the materials make me think this will last a long time. I’ll update my post if they don’t last. (Ps: feels great if you also wear glasses)

    Ich habe noch nie ein so hochwertiges Headset besessen, dem zu Folge kann ich es nicht mit anderen vergleichen. Meine Erwartungen hat es jedoch voll erfüllt.Beim Auspacken viel mir gleich auf, wie gut die Kabel sind, die dem Headset beiliegen. Besserer und vor allem weniger anfälliger Schutzmantel, sauberer Anschluss an den Stecker - die Kabel gehen mir jedenfalls nicht so schnell wieder kaputt. Und das beste - sie sind abnehmbar und damit einzeln ersetzbar.Das Headset ist aus Kunststoff, wirkt aber stabil und ist überraschend schwer. Der Bügel endet bei mir relativ weit Vorne auf dem Kopf. Ich empfinde das als sehr angenehm, weil er dann nicht über der empfindlichen Mitte des Kopfes liegt. Der Bügel wird sowieso wenig belastet. Der Andruck der Hörmuscheln auf den Kopf ist angenehm. Ich hatte in verschiedenen Rezensionen gelesen, er sei sehr fest. Nun, mein Bezugspunkt ist da wohl ein anderer (Schutzkopfhörer für die Arbeit), den für mich ist er passeend, obwohl ich gerade hinter dem Ohr recht empfindlich auf Druck reagiere. Das Polster der Hörer ist sehr weich.Klangqualität und Mikrofon erscheinen mir deutlich besser, als was ich es bisher kenne. Auch Musik lässt sich damit gut hören. Meiner Meinung nach macht es dabei sowohl die Höhen als auch die Tiefen super mit.Das Mikrofon ist abnehmbar und durch eine kleine Scheibe ersetzbar. Davon liegen gleich zwei dabei. Abschalten lässt sich das Mikro, indem man es einfach hoch klappt. Gut brauchbar, wenn man während eines Gespräches gestört wird. Beide Funktionen sind praktisch, aber wegen des dünnen Mikroarms sollte man aufpassen, das Mikro möglichst dicht am Bügel anzufassen, damit es nicht irgendwann vielleicht doch bricht. Nicht das es so wirkt als bräche es schnell, aber Vorsicht ist besser als nochmal kaufen. Lautstärken lässt an der rechten Hörmuschel regulieren. Für manche Fälle leichter als auf die Lautstärkeregler am Gerät zurückzugreifen.Ich habe es im Angebot gekauft und bin mit Preis/Leistung sehr zufrieden.

    I have had this headset for over a year and I am quite happy with it. It's not perfect but luckily I found ways to fix the only major issues I have had with it.PRO TIPS! To get the most out of this headset I have some recommendations:I found that the headset on PC was too quiet and didn't get loud enough. To fix this I found out that you can download steelseries GG software and make adjustments in sonar, even though this headset is a completely different brand. In the game tab, scroll down past the EQ and there is an option to enable ""volume boost."" I turned this all the way up to +12 and the headset is SIGNIFICANTLY louder. Also you can fine tune EQ and save presets with sonar to dial in the sound profile. You're welcome!The other issue I had was that the ear pads were stiff enough that they really irritated my head after a while, especially wearing glasses. Luckily this was also a relatively easy fix. I found a youtube video recommending replacement pads from Dekoni Audio. I purchased the Jerzee mesh pads and they are much softer and more comfortable than the original, which completely solved that problem. The headset does still create a bit of a pressure point at the top of my head because of the uniform shape of the headband cushion, so I wish it had a gap at the top like other headsets but it's not that bad.https://www.amazon.com/Replacement-Sennheiser-Headphones-Headphone-Cushions/dp/B08DSL5KH8?ref_=ast_sto_dp&th=1The headset overall is great. I love that it is open back, has a nice wide soundstage and the sound just feels big and rich with detail. Sound is a bit bass heavy and sometimes can sound muddy but you can change EQ in sonar to help with that some. I find that open back creates less listening fatigue over time and I can still hear my own voice without sidetone and I can hear whats going on around me.Build quality is outstanding and comfort is really good (with the new pads at least). The design works very well to create a good fit around the head. Love the big deep ear cups and drivers.I bought this headset used from amazon for I think $70, and there were no issues. At that price this headset is an incredible deal and I recommend 100%. Retail price is definitely steep, but you wont be disappointed with build quality. I'd say $60-$120 is an ideal price and feels like excellent value.

    Après avoir eu un Corsair Void Pro pendant presque 5 ans il était temps de changer de casque.Je m'étais tout d'abord tourné vers le Corsair HS80 RGB Wireless mais pas convaincu de la qualité sonore et de la durée de la batterie j'ai essayé le Arctis Nova 7+ qui à une meilleur qualité de son mais qui à une qualité de micro vraiment pas folle et une qualité de construction qui fait vraiment cheap comparé au Corsair HS80.J'ai commencé avec le Epos h6 pro fermé qui est vraiment super confortable avec une très bonne restitution sonore et une isolation au poil voir un peu trop à mon gout, en effet je n'arrivais même plus à m'entendre parler tellement qu'il isolait ce qui est terriblement troublant. J'ai donc décidé de prendre son frère qui est ouvert et qui est globalement le même que celui fermé mais en isolant pas, seul bémol à la version ouverte c'est les coussinet que je trouve moins confortable surtout avec des lunettes et qui appuie plus sur le crane car étant légèrement plus épais.Par ailleurs je vous conseille d'acheter un autre câble compatible en caoutchouc car les câbles tressé ont tendance à s'entendre à l'oreille lorsque qu'il y a du frottement.En conclusion si vous souhaitez un bon casque pour jouer, écouter de la musique et regarder des films l'Epos h6 est vraiment superbe, il ne vous restera plus qu'à choisir entre la version ouvert ou fermé selon si vous préférez une bonne isolation ou non.

    I really tried to love this headset. The build quality is really good and you can feel it right after you open the box. Yet I have to point that the sound quality is not as good as it seems. If you are a competitive gamer on a budget, get yourself a shp9500 or 9600. If you want a on par build quality, get the Beyer dt770/990 pro. If you want a superior sound with a mic, grab the drop pc38x.

    Cuffia pensata per l'utenza gaming di una ex branca, ora indipendente, di Sennheiser. Si propone come modello aperto con microfono integrato e regolatore di volume. La qualità dei materiali usati è sufficientemente superiore (archetto parzialmente in metallo con tanto di numeri per la regolazione, padiglioni ricoperti in microfibra sempre freschi) a quanto usato da altri concorrenti come Razer e TB, più simile Hyperx. Rispetto a quest'ultima chiede un prezzo quasi doppio non offrendo nulla di eclatante dal punto di vista sonoro. Tarata verso bassi consistenti e dei buoni alti perde in spazialità del suono, risulta tutto molto vicino all utente tanto da non sembrare una cuffia aperta, e da notare che viene proposta in entrambe le versioni. Non c'è senso di distanza delle sorgenti e gli oggetti sonori affrontano uno ""spigolo"" quando passano dal fronte al retro che può disorientare.Anche l'ascolto musicale ne soffre, il palcoscenico è decisamente ristretto per poter essere coinvolgente ma rimane abbastanza divertente, di certo non vi donerà una dimensione più ampia delle vostre tracce preferite.Le funzionalità dedicate al gaming sono oggettivamente un punto a favore: la possibilità di regolare il volume dal padiglione destro va bene (livello minimo 5% si narra sia dovuto allo smarrimento di alcuni utenti che dimenticandoselo allo 0, ritenevano che la cuffia avesse smesso di funzionare, così si decise per il minimo 5%) e il microfono è preciso, pulito e molto comodo potendolo spegnere spostando il meccanismo verso l'alto e risulta rimovibile grazie all'aggancio magnetico. Viene fornito anche un dischetto per coprire la zona rimasta scoperta insomma uno dei migliori integrati in cuffie. Ma comunque non mi ha convinto appieno. Ci sono cuffie che costano se non la metà, addirittura la metà della metà che risultano molto più soddisfacenti sia nell'ascolto musicale che per chi dovesse giocare. Nel secondo caso risulta spesso fondamentale la presenza di un microfono. Con lo stesso budget dell'Epos H6pro (180 al momento della recensione) potete prendere cuffie migliori, microfono a condensatore con tanto di braccio e avanzare qualche decina di euro. Nessuno chiede per questa cifra le stesse performance di un Hd800, ma una Cloud Alpha, una hd 599 o una umilissima Superlux hd681 si giocano meglio le proprie carte. Mi sa tanto di occasione sprecata anche perché dal punto di vista estetico e tattile sono veramente piacevoli, la colorazione verde scuro è una chicca e la scelta di abbinare inserti dorati ne accentua il carattere. Fossero state con un soundstage più aperto e puntuale e una riproduzione anche solo leggermente più verso il neutro (di poco, si può mantenere comunque una sonorità divertente) sarebbe stata una recensione molto differente.

    Amazing mic quality, and sound quality. I use them mostly for gaming, and am able to pinpoint sounds so easily. Especially in games like Hunt: Showdown which have great sound design. Would not recommend if you game in a loud area as they do let some sound in being open back.

    Nachdem mein Sennheiser PC 350 SE mit seinen 12 Jahren langsam aber sicher auseinanderbröselt, wollte ich mir endlich ein neues Headset zulegen.Ich habe auf das immer so oft erwähnte Beyerdynamics MMX 300 geschielt, weil man relativ oft davon im Bereich PC-Gaming gelesen hat/liest.Nach einigem einlesen in die Materie bin ich aber schnell davon abgekommen, weil es einfach ein Beyerdynamics 770 mit Micro sein soll und somit maßlos überteuert war.Ich besorgte mir nun aufgrund mehrerer gelesener Wertungsseiten folgende Headsets:Beyerdynamics 770 Pro 250 OhmBeyerdynamics 990 Pro 250 OhmHyper Cloud X AlphaEpos H6 ProBetrieben wurden alle vier Kopfhörer/Headsets an einem Creativ SB X G6 in diversen Modi, aber überwiegend im Direct Mode.Ein verstellen des Equalizers kam für mich nicht in Frage. Wenn ich ~150 Euro für einen Kopfhörer ausgebe, dann muss das in den Standarteinstellungen passen und nicht erst durch herumdoktorn gelöst werden müssen.Gespielt wurden: Warhammer 40K Darktide, Warhammer 40K Deamongate, War Thunder und ein paar andere Titel. Des weiteren wurden Metal, Klassik und Synthietitel angehört um einen etwaigen Vergleich zu erlangen.Test: Beyerdynamics:Vorweg, die Beyerdynamics hatten den saubersten und ausgewogensten Klang für meine Ohren. Ich hab lange nicht verstanden wovon in den Foren immer geredet wird, wenn von einem hochauflösenden, klaren, granularen, gleichmäßig auf Höhen/Tiefen/Mitten verteilten Klang geredet wurde.Als ich die beiden BD auf hatte, wusste ich was gemeint war. Es war schlichtweg ein Genuss damit in die Games reinzuhöhren.Behalten hätte ich dann tatsächlich das 990 Pro, weil mir das offene System einfach besser gefallen hat, weiter/räumlicher wirkte und man trotzdem noch ein wenig was von der ""Außenwelt"" mitbekommt.Gescheitert ist es dann letztendlich aber an dem sogenannten Beyerpeak. Die Höhen waren so klar definiert und hatten für meine Ohren wirklich grantige Spitzen, dass ich nach spätestens einer Std durch. war und die Höhrer abnehmen musste. Sehr schade muss ich sagen. Mich hats wirklich sehr gereut die beiden Modelle wieder zurücksenden zu müssen, aber so konnte ich nicht zocken. Im Scout-Mode schon gleich fünfmal nicht. Da meinte ich, mir piekst jemand ins Ohr.Dann das HyperX:Wie bitte in allen Herr Gotts Namen kann dieses Teil so gut bewertet werden!? Ich hatte es lediglich in Darktide auf und war der Meinung in einer Blechröhre zu sitzen. Grottenschlecht. Dumpfer Sound, Hall ohne Ende und keine Räumlichkeit. Sofort wieder ab in die Verpackung. Aber gut, ist auch eine andere Preisklasse. Weg damit.Das EPOS H6Pro (offen) in Racing Green:Das Teil ist super verpackt und macht optisch einen sehr tollen Eindruck. Für Gamer. Musikliebhabern wird das erstmal wurscht sein nehme ich an.Klar, viel Plastik, aber alles ist sauber und schlüssig verarbeitet. Der Volumeregler hat den optimalen Widerstand und lässt sich reibungslos drehen. Die Arretierung für das abnehmbare Mikro ist robust und ohne Schnickschnack gebaut und verspricht so Langlebigkeit.Nun aber zum wichtigsten, dem Klang. Basslastiger als die BDs. Die Höhen und Tiefen kommen gut rüber, die Mitten rutschen etwas in den Hintergrund, aber nicht zu Lasten der Räumlichkeit. Ortung funktioniert mit diesem Headset genausogut wie mit den BDs.Nach langem Hin- und Herprobieren hab ich mich dann für das EPOS H6 Pro entschieden.Zum einen brauch ich kein Extra Mikro, zum anderen hatte ich da kein Problem mit den ebenso klaren Höhen, die jedoch nicht diese unangenehmen Spitzen wie die BDs hatten. Die leicht in den Hintergrund gerückten Mitten sind verkraftbar. Der Bass ist gut und definitiv nicht schwammig, sondern schon eher knackig und verleiht Explosionen oder einem MG das nötige Volumen.Ich persönlich bin sehr froh mit dem Epos und habe mein nächstes Headset gefunden und genieße es so oft ich kann. Guter Klang ist einfach unerläßlich für eine ordentliche Immersion in Games.Zu den Passformen möchte ich nicht viel sagen, denn jeder Kopf ist anders. Allerdings, sehr bequem waren die Polster der BDs, von der Form und Größe her, sowie vom Anliegen an den Kopf kam mir das Epos besser vor.Ich hoffe einigen mit meiner Rezension geholfen zu haben. Die Suche im Headsetdschungel hätte mich fast wahnsinnig gemacht, weshalb es mir die Mühe wert erschien, eine ausführliche Rezi zu schreiben.Game on!

    Me deje llevar por la marca que es y porque se supone que son de lo mejor que hay para gaming, pero me han decepcionado bastante.Yo los uso para Series X y PS5 y no cumplen, el sonido NO se escucha nitido, parece como ""¿hueco? ¿en una cueva?"".Actualmente tengo unos HyperX Earbuds 2, que son unos auriculares gaming de 40€ y se escuchan mejor que estos en juegos de PS5 y Series X , con eso lo digo todo. Y para musica mis Sony wh-1000xm3 le dan mil vueltas en todo y encima son inalambricos con cancelacion de ruido.Con el amplificador que vende la marca seguro qeu mejora, pero este amplificador no se puede poner en consolas creo, asi que no valdria para mi.Resumen: Si lo que quieres es jugar en ps5 o series x, olvidate de estos auriculares, el sonido es bastante malo.

    Regularly used for 2 years so far. I originally got these for 3 reasons: open-back, looks, and good sound quality.Open-back was important to me so I could hear my dog, my surroundings, and my own voice better. Hearing my own voice helped me lower my own speaking volume a bit.Sound quality is good. Do keep in mind they're open-back, so the bass is never going to be impactful - with that expectation in mind, everything sounds pretty good and it's relatively easy listening (not exhausting like some more punchy headphones)Also very comfortable for long periods. My last two sets of headphones were uncomfortable after longer sessions (Bose QC35, Sony WH-1000XM4). These ones don't leave a dent in my head, don't clamp too hard on my very sensitive temple area, and don't heat up my head/ears. I sometimes forget I'm wearing them!I usually use it without the microphone. The microphone itself is ""fine"". The connection for the microphone is not - I usually have to push the attach point hard a couple times, because the contact pins don't seem to make proper contact and no sound goes through until I do. Likely just a problem with my unit, but notable.My skin oils are very hard on ears cups and such. These ones are definitely degrading and starting to show signs of wear, but they're probably good for a while yet.

Il faut dire que je viens d un Sennheiser 560 S qui est un poids plume à côtéJe pense le retourner et revenir vers mon sennheiser pour des raisons de conforts, au niveau du son il est meme plus précis..Pour ce qui ne connaissent pas les casques gamer, pour le prix ca vaut le coup mais niveau confort ca va dependre de vous et de l age de vos os...

    Ich habe mir das Headset geholt, weil die Ohrpolster auseinander gehen von meinem alten Headset. Und da es vier Jahre alt ist...warum nicht. Ich dachte die Tonqualität, wäre jetzt praktisch ein ""wow"" Faktor, bei diesem Preis. Muss aber feststellen, das es für mich enttäuschend war.Bei meinem alten Headset (Roccat Khan) sind die Schritte in Shooter Games viel deutlicher zu hören und klarer. Bei diesem Headset war es oke, aber nicht befriedigend, auch klang für mich alles so stumpf, als wäre ich in einem Flugzeug oder so. Vielleicht auch einfach gewöhnungsbedürftig, aber einfach nicht mein Fall.Zum Miko: Niemand beklagte sich über meine Stimme, außer das es sehr leise war, was dann schnell gefixt wurde. Sonst konnte man sich nicht beklagen. Sollte für den Preis allerdings auch selbstverständlich sein.Komfort: Ich hab es mehrere Stunden getragen und muss sagen, das es sehr angenehm war auf den Ohren und Kopf. Nach ca. 4 Stunden hab ich oben am Kopf langsam Kopfweh bekommen, hab das Headset mit den Bügeln einfach ein wenig weiter gestellt und dann ging es wieder. Man muss einfach seine Einstellung dann für sich finden und dann passt es.Ich habe Irrtürmlicher weise gedacht das es über USB-Stecker an den Pc gesteckt wird. Nicht drauf geachtet. Somit musste ich hinten am Pc meine Boxen rausmachen und hätte für diese rosa-gelben Stecker extra etwas kaufen müssen, damit meine Boxen wieder rein dürfen.Ich denke für Gaming ist es sehr gut, aber bei Shooter Games würde ich hier etwas anderes suchen, da es nicht so meins war.Alles in einem...es geht zurück und ich benutze mein altes Headset wieder, da nur die Ohrpolster auseinander fielen und ich jetzt neue Ersatzteile bestellt habe und die passen. Headset fast wie neu und ich hab kein ärger mehr, welches teure Headsets in Frage kommen.

    First of all this is not a audiophile gaming headset, they're a gaming headset with audiophile features so if you're looking for audiophile open backs then just buy actual open back headphones.H6pro open vs PC38xSound quality goes to PC38xBuild quality goes to H6pro by alot (just wow)Comfort goes to H6proIf youre looking for that pure neutral sound for gaming and listening to music then the PC38x are amazing and pretty comfortable but theyre very light plastic so for the money youre getting amazing sound and what feels like cheap plastic.If youre looking for amazing sounding super comfortable gaming headphones that you can EQ the neutral tuned sound to whatever you like for gaming and music with the open back design that eliminates ear fatigue almost completely then the H6Pro open backs are for you.The PC38x sound like 10% better but are built way cheaper and are less comfortable and theyre both the same price, your ears float inside the H6pros which makes the soundstage sound amazing for gaming. Everything about the H6pro says quality and comfort and you also get similar sound quality to the PC38x but the highs are a bit loud so you can hear footsteps really easily but gunfire can be uncomfortable which is why a DAC is amazing so you can turn down the slightly over tuned treble in the H6pro open backs.Bottom line theyre amazing sounding, super comfortable, and youre getting quality worth the price tag. The PC37x are like half the price of the PC38x and sound almost as good so if youre not looking for the ultimate build quality and comfort with amazing sound of the H6PROs then the PC37x are in the proper price bracket for what youre getting.

    Bought these to replace my DT990s that had their right ear pack in. Had some trouble at first which ended up being a problem unrelated on my end, that resulted in an experience with their customer support who was about as useful as a paper bag in the rain.Had a GSX1000 arrive after these headphones arrived which I couldn't possibly not recommend if you're in it for the audio quality.The detachable mic was a splended addition, ideal for me since I have a standalone mic.The headphones are very comfortable once properly adjusted, however not as comfortable if you have glasses.Amazon asked me about Noise cancellation which these headphones don't do, as for as i know. and being the open varient would be pointless.I saw another reviewer having trouble with the sound quality, which I must assume was a bad defect or connection issue on their end since mine arrived just fine. I will note, that the 3.5mm jack these supply are 4 pole, and may have issues connecting to a 3 pole connector.

    Schon sehr lange war ich auf der Suche nach einem guten, offenen (!) Headset. Ich möchte meine Umgebung noch wahrnehmen können, daher konnte ich mich mit keinem der geschlossenen Modelle anfreunden.Bei dem Epos passt alles: es sitzt gut, aber nicht zu fest. Es drückt nicht auf die Ohren! Und es hat einen hervorragenden, vollvolumigen und leicht basslastigen Klang, der sich auch für Musik gut eignet. Und dennoch kann ich in der Umgebung hören, was vor sich geht.Drei kleine Mankos könnte man anbringen: es ist ein recht schweres Headset (aber es ist qualitativ auch hervorragend, irgendwo muss das herkommen). Das schwenkbare Mikrofon löst sich schnell mal aus der Magnethalterung (aber so kann man es auch schnell mal beiseite legen). Und es gibt keinen Lautstärkeregler (das ist in der Tat schade, aber kein Weltuntergang).Alles in Allem für mich trotzdem 5 Sterne!

    So to preface this review, I've had a lot of headphones both for music and gaming. I'm not an audiophile, but I am quite particular when it comes to sound. I've had HyperX Cloud2, SteelSeries, V-Moda, Sony XM3.These headphones (open) are now my favourite for both music and gaming.Comfort:  these do not clamp against your head like some have reviewed on the closed back. There's enough adjustability in the headband to get the sizing just right and stays in place nicely.  I don't suffer from hot ears or sweaty head after hours of gaming, and I really don't feel like I've got anything on. You will not fatigue with these one bit.  I found my HyperX to be very comfortable, but when trying these and going back to the HyperX, you can tell they're in different leagues (price wise you certainly are)Sound quality:  this area is highly subjective like anything audio related it comes down to personal preference.  I saw a lot of reviews saying the profile was relatively flat and lacked low end when compare to the closed.  I can't comment on the closed, but I was pleasantly surprised how much low end it had when expecting such a flat profile.  Both gaming and music, these things just sing.  Playing FPS games I could hear footsteps and direction of enemy much clearer than HyperX.  Explosions and bullets sounded amazing!Sound leakage:  these are my first open back headphones.  But the wife didn't complain hearing my gaming/music when played at same volume as HyperX. Not to say its not there, because it certainly is. But in a typical sized front living room, with my wife sat on the other sofa, she had to concentrate to hear anything. Happy wife, happy gamer!Music:  I compared these to my Sony wh1000 XM3, which I love.  I wasn't expecting much at first as the two couldn't be more different with Sony having ANC and closed back vs non-ANC and open back.  But I was taken aback by how good music sounded on these. Obviously these are basically Sennheiser headphones, and so should sound very good!  But it wasn't something I thought I'd appreciate quite as much as I did. The clarity, clear crisp highs and rumbling lows were welcomed, I cranked the volume up and no distortion. You could happily listen to Rap/R&B, hip hop, dance, pop, rock... they are truly versatile.Microphone:  I like how you can magnetically remove the mic if you wanted.  It rotates up to mute the mic automatically.  From what others have fed back, my voice is clear and not too loud, with no background noise either. Though can't comment too much as not heard the results myself only feedback of others I've played withI highly recommend these headphones for either gaming or music.

    Je me suis pris ce casque car ayant eu une bonne expérience avec un Sennheiser pc 363d que j'avais changé avec regret pour un Beyerdynamic MMX qui m'a lâché au bout de 3 ans... Du coup mon dernier casque de comparaison est un Hyperx cloud II qui est très en dessous niveau son et micro par rapport à cet Epos h6pro ouvert. J'ai écouté de la musique en qualité cd ou hi-res et bien il est au niveau d'un casque hi-fi comme le Philips Fidelio HR avec des basses plus présente mais c'est normal vu son orientation gaming. Le micro est très bon bien meilleur que sur le hyperx cloud et bien plus pratique avec la perche à relever pour mute rapidement. Sinon niveau confort après 3h de jeu aucune douleur et pourtant j'ai d'assez grande oreille qui rentre tout juste dans le coussinet mais aucune gêne pour ça. Le casque est branché sur une carte son créative sound blaster z donc je pense que cela doit en tirer la quintessence en tout cas je suis vraiment content de cet achat car c'est un très beau casque bien finit et super rapport qualité prix avec promo !

    Compré estos auriculares, porque vine de unos Corsair HS80 que los tuve que devolver porque están hechos para personas con la cabeza pequeña. Si eres una persona grande, los Corsair HS80 no son para ti y estos tampoco.Compré los Epos después de hincharme a ver videos, buscar en foros, buscar en tiendas, y supuestamente estos auriculares con forme los pintaban en las reviews eran una maravilla, era auténtica calidad de audio. Para mí sorpresa cuando me llegaron me dejaron bastante de desear ya que los auriculares pesan bastante poco y da la impresión de poca calidad, los acabados están bien pero son muy plásticos.La ergonomía de los auriculares por imágenes se veían los drivers de las orejas grandes, cuando los recibes ves que no es así. La verdad que los Compré también porque sus almohadillas no son de piel y así no hervirte en verano, son de tela. Pero no son nada cómodos de verdad, cuando llevo 1 hora o 2 puestos me dan dolores de oido.Los auriculares sinceramente no están hechos para gaming ni para escuchar música, son plug and play y tienen software configurable pero no los puedes configurar si no te compras una tarjeta de audio externa de la marca Epos o un Dac.Me compré el modelo abierto ya que según reviews de canales americanos, los cerrados te aislaban demasiado y no podías escuchar si estas gritando y el sistema de audio que tienen para shooters estilo fortnite, csgo, no interpretaban nada bien el juego. Y estos la verdad que tampoco sirven, son abiertos pero no escuchas tu voz, no interpreta bien el posicionamiento en los juegos. Para escuchar música no sirven ya que cuando subes el volumen de los auriculares medio-alto, tus amigos de discord escuchan el sonido de tus auriculares. Se cuela el sonido, y en el exterior también se cuela, es decir NEFASTO.Lo único bueno que tienen es el microfono que capta muy buena calidad de voz y ya.Sinceramente, no los compréis porque para jugar no sirven y para escuchar música tampoco, son incómodos y en general todo bastante mal excepto el micrófono. No hagáis caso a las opiniones de los foros y de los canales de YouTube como yo hice, porque iréis mal.

    J'ai eu ce casque depuis maintenant plus d'un an, et je suis finalement plutôt déçu de mon achat :Avantages : - Bon son, - Super confort, notamment en été ou je souffrais beaucoup de la chaleur avec mon Hyper X Cloud II, - Joli design, - Micro détachable / attachable facilement grâce à des aimants (sur le papier), - Position ouverte et fermée du micro : quand on le lève et qu'on entend un ""clic"", plus aucun son n'est détecté.Désavantages : - Le micro peut être levé pour qu'il ne détecte plus de son, et il est détachable / attachable facilement, mais après un an d'utilisation il me faut environ 10 manipulations (changement de position + détachement / réattachement) pour espérer qu'il soit détecté par mes ordis.... Le casque en devient insupportable et je vais finir par en changer pour cette raison, - C'était un choix volontaire pour lutter contre la chaleur et pour rester dispo pour mes proches, mais le fait que ce soit un casque ouvert et que j'ai un gros PC rend les jeux compétitifs compliqués, on entend vraiment tout ce qui se passe hors du casque... notamment son propre PC :D Je ne reproche rien au casque, mais je n'avais pas réalisé à quel point un casque ""ouvert"" ne bloquerait aucun son extérieur.

    Packet erhalten, ausgepackt, Headset angeklemmt, geprüft, abgeklemmt und wieder für den Rückversand vorbereitet :DAktuell lebe ich noch mit meinem mittlerweile Ü 10 Jahren alten Sennheiser PC 360, welches leider einen kleinen Wackelkontakt auf einer Seite über die Jahre bekommen hat. Daher sollte was neues her.Die Marke EPOS ist aus Sennheiser hervorgegangen und da ich wirklich mehr als zufrieden mit meinem aktuellen Sennheiser Produkt bin, fiel mal Wahl auf EPOS.+Offene Akustik - mag ich. Man bekommt noch was vom Umfeld mit. Kann sich beim Daddeln mit der Außenwelt unterhalten und bekommt auch mit wenn die Tür klingelt oder der Backofen-timer abläuft. Auch beim EPOS H6Pro open passt das alle. Die Kopfhörer sind angenehm ohrumschließend, es drückt an dieser Ecke schon mal nix unangenehm (zumindest nicht direkt am Ohr). Mit offener Akustik geht auch ein angenehmeres Ohr-Klima einher.-Ton-Qualität - hier liegt meine Hauptkritik - da hätte ich deutlich mehr erwartet. Ich empfand den Ton als sehr unangenehm... es scheppert, klingt dünn bis blechern. Ich bin wahrlich kein Sound-Experte, daher will ich hier auch gar nicht zu sehr versuchen es genauer zu beschreiben. Ich habe den direkten Vergleich mit dem PC360 gemacht und das H6Pro lag hier ziemlich weit hinter. Verschlechtern möchte man sich ja auch nicht...-Anpressdruck - tja... das Ding sitzt zu Beginn zieeemlich fest aufm Kopp. Nach den ersten 10min wurde es schon beinahe unangenehm und man neigt dazu beim längeren Tragen die Ohrmuscheln kurz vom Kopf abzuhebeln um den Blutfluss in der Region zu gewährleisten. Möglich, dass sich dies mit der Zeit etwas gibt - ich wollte es nicht darauf ankommen lassen.Mich hat dieses Produkt mit der Preisklasse leider nicht überzeugen können.

    I bought the open back and closed back version and the open back sound is amazing. I suffer from noise cancelling headphones building pressure in my ears and these fix that issues.  Also, it is nice to hear your own voice so you don’t get that feeling as though you are underwater.  I also use these for listening to music and they have a lovely balanced sound.  Although they are open back, the ‘sound leakage’ I.e. what people can hear around you is actually quite minimal.  I would be happy using these in a cafe or on a train at a moderate level.The mic is also one of the best I have used. Everyone comments on how clear your voice is either when gaming or making phone calls.Bang for buck, there is nothing like these headphone and it has convinced me to used wired headsets as opposed to Bluetooth which, was always my go to.Get them. You won’t be disappointed.  Oh and comfort is absolutely superb.

    These are open back which I prefer for gaming. Wider sound stage and sense of scale over closed back. They aren’t as punchy as closed back, but still very good. Replaced my Astro A40 and Mixamp with just these. Very comfortable and well built. Love the magnetic quick removing mic. Can’t go wrong with these.

    No entiendo exactamente que pasa con este tipo de productos. No tiene sentido que los cascos funcionen tan mal, cuando tienen buenas críticas online.No sé si puede ser porque no esté acostumbrado a los cascos abiertos, pero el sonido es horriblemente vacío. No sé si esa es la idea de este tipo de cascos, pero me parece un sinsentido que se escuche todo como... ¿con eco? y al escuchar música algunos sonidos se distorsionan.

    Bought these to replace my aging Sennheisers, but the sound quality is worse, the mic is worse and they are less comfortable. Ive had 3 of the Sennheiser g4me ones and they all develop the same issue with the boom mic mute failing. At least they sound decent and work well for a couple years. These EPOS headsets must be using much lower quality components. If you are looking for a good open back headset look elsewhere.

    Where to start here. I used three differents type of microphones/headsets during a live stream and asked to my followers which one was the best and which one was the worst. This one was. It was either too strong for them or too quiet. Nothing in the middle so you really really need a foam, but it won't make things better. The microphone on console is just awful.Now the sound. Muffled and not just a little, but very very muffled. It was ok if you play a FPS game, but any other games the ost or voice acting will be very very bad. I tried the headset with a sound blaster card after this and well, that wasn't better.Was it better than the JBL Quantum one (which is a bad joke). No. It's in this category. I had a Razer Nari that provides better sound than this piece garbage.Didn't try on PC. Probably sounds better with some mods, but on console, STAY AWAY.

    I recently purchased the EPOS H6PRO Open headphones and have been using them extensively, particularly for gaming. The sound quality is truly impressive, especially considering that they are open-back headphones. The audio is crisp, clear, and immersive, providing an excellent gaming experience. The open-back design allows for a wide soundstage, which is a significant advantage in FPS games.However, I did find some issues with comfort. After prolonged use, I noticed discomfort under my ears. It seems that the design of the ear pads might not be the best fit for me. This is something potential buyers might want to consider, especially if they plan on using the headphones for extended periods.Adding to this, if you can find the EPOS H6PRO Open Green headphones on sale for 100 euros or less, they are an absolute steal. The sound quality and gaming experience they provide at this price point is truly exceptional. Despite the comfort issue I experienced, the overall value they offer at this discounted price is outstanding.Overall, the EPOS H6PRO Open headphones deliver excellent sound quality, particularly for gaming. However, the comfort level might not meet everyone’s expectations. Despite this, I believe they offer good value for their price point, given the superior audio experience they provide. Happy gaming!

    Der Sound ist Sennheiser typisch 1A aber der Kopfhörer wird mir schnell unbequem.Er drückt besonders auf dem Kopf und der Anpressdruck an den Ohren ist mir auch etwas zu stark.Für 2-3 Stunden ist es ok aber nach drei Stunden fängt es an mir weh zu tun.

    Ich habe das HS gekauft, da es einen guten Rabatt hatte und die Bewertungen mich neugierig gemacht haben, ob es was für mich wäre.Der erste Eindruck war gut, sieht leicht aus, fühlt sich auch angenehm auf dem Kopf und den Ohren an.Jedoch kam dann der Schreck. Es ist nur auf der rechten Seite Sound und das auch teilweise sehr klirrend und unverständlich.Ich habe daraufhin alles versucht was so möglich war. Sei es Treiber deinstalliert, neu installiert oder sogar das Hauseigene Programm von EPOS heruntergeladen, aber selbst das erkennt das HS nicht als HS an, sondern mehr als Lautsprecher. An meinem PC kann es eigentlich nicht liegen, weil mein altes HS was ich ersetzen wollte auch mit Klinkenstecker funktioniert und da gibt es keine Probleme.Habe es auch an meinem Laptop probiert gehabt, jedoch selbes Ergebnis und wird als Lautsprecher und nicht als HS erkannt.Zum Mikrofon kann ich nicht sagen, da es wie geschrieben nicht als solches erkannt wird.Schade eigentlich, da es sehr hochwertig wirkt und bequem ist.Fazit: Ich würde es empfehlen, jedoch nicht wundern wenn es vielleicht auch so eine technische Macke hat, wie das was ich getestet habe.

    I really like the openness of them, really nice crisp audio with more bass than i was expecting. If youre into gaming, the footsteps seem to be pretty distinct compared to other headsets and the feeling of directional/distance awareness is perfect.The one and only thing I am hating and genuinely mad about is how uncomfy the earpads are. The headphones are light on the head but it feels like they got the WORST stiff foam to press hard against your skull. Idk if theres a way to break in earpads immediately but youre better off buying 3rd party earpads, or buying headphones that are $30 more expensive cause you'll end up wanting to buy earpads.

    I am actually astounded at how many people sing the praises of this headset when it is quite easily the worst headset I've ever used in my life, let alone for the ridiculous price range these apparently belong in.- The sound quality was awful, the overall volume had to be so low in order to preserve any kind of clarity which you could barely hear because it had to be so low. When raising the volume, the bass would distort so loudly the mids and trebles would get drowned out.- The build quality felt good in the hands and to look at, but immediately felt uncomfortable when wearing them. The earpads were a good shape for the ears but the material was like having 4 bricks cemented around the driver.- Despite what many sources have said, this DOES NOT work with Epos software and DOES NOT HAVE SIDETONE. Also the microphone which I had, did not sound anything like some of the microphones on reviews of this product, which did vary quite drastically video to video. (Post editing most likely)- The connections on this headset are AWFUL quality, I had to unplug and replug the wire upwards of 5 times and spin it in the fixture until finally both earcups engaged and was not missing any frequency.I honestly expected so much better for a headset in this price range from, supposedly, the gaming division of Sennheiser. I have never refunded anything in my life so fast and I really tried to like it to save the hassle of a return, but I simply feel like I have been SCAMMED.

    Audio quality isn't bad and having a volume slider is nice for when things are too loud but the quality is not there when it comes to reliability.

    I wanted open back headphones, more comfy, and you can still hear doorbells, the phone ringing etc. These seemed overpriced but you can't go wrong with Sennheiser or so I thought.Basically for gaming these are adequate. But if you do anything else like listen to music, watch youtube or whatever, these are surprisingly poor. Play Michael Jackson's 'Man In The Mirror' through them and they just can't cope. The driver in these is located up and away from your ear and it makes everything sound distant. The higher the frequency, the more distant and tinny it sounds. The bass is pretty good, no complaints there but for this price you'd expect more. These don't even do 7.1 surround. (They will if you pay an extra £70 for a sound card). HyperX are offering wireless headphones with 7.1 for half this price, it's a bit bizarre.The microphone does the job but nothing amazing, and as with a lot of headphones these days they do put too much pressure on your head.I returned these and got Sennheiser's Gaming One headset instead, they're far superior.

    A very good headset. It has surprisingly good sound quality for its price. In my opinion, it’s far better than it’s it’s more expensive sibling (Recon 50) which I’ve also used. The synthetic leather earcups are also a great feature, as they feel very comfortable, lower the cost, and are cruelty free. A great headset for people on a budget, but who want a high quality brand.

    I bought this for my PlayStation 4, it works great especially for the price. The audio is good, it has a mute option and volume control.  It’s quite sturdy, just be aware of the headphone jack so you don’t accidentally bend it like I did hahaha.This also works on multiple devices, I even started using it to listen to music on my iPad. (If you plan to do this, make sure your iPad has a headphone jack, or whatever it’s called)I bought a kraken headset after this one for nearly double the price and it was ridiculous in comparison, audio was worse, no, mic or volume control. I now have a new found appreciation for Turtle Beach. <3

    Priced reasonably, this headset feels like it's noise cancelling (although it's not). It fits the head well and the sound quality is brilliant in terms of gaming. The mic is easy to turn on and off.Although it's majorly plastic this product definitely does not feel cheap or badly designed/finished.Super simple to use. Would recommend buying.

    If you are on a budget and looking for something that will get the job done, this is enough. You get what you pay for. Just do note that the black coat on the padding peels off easily and it's not that comfortable. If you play for 2 hours or more, it heats up your ears. I also tried using it for work calls and the mic sounds good, no issues.

    Die Kopfhörer haben mich vom Tragekomfort und vom Klang her doch sehr überrascht, dass hatte ich für den günstigen Preis nicht erwartet. Auch nach einem längeren Tragen fühlen sich die Ohrmuscheln immer noch bequem an. Der Klang und der Bass ist sehr gut und hört sich wertig und voll an. Das Spielen macht damit deutlich mehr Spass. Die Gegner sind gut zu orten und es kommt ein gutes, allgemeines Raumgefühl rüber. Die Verarbeitungsqualität ist ebenso gut, nichts klappert und die Länge lässt sich einstellen. Der Kopfbügel ist auch nach längerem Tragen noch bequem und drückt bei mir nicht.

    I am actually very pleased with this headset. I wear it for a good part of my day and it is actually pretty comfortable. I can wear it for a couple hours before I even notice it's there. It is way lighter than my old Razer headset. And it actually fits my small head. Since I am using it on PC, I had to buy an adapter for it, but I knew this going in and was totally fine with that. For the price, this headset sounds great. I mean, it does sound really, really good. Although when my Razer headset was working properly, it was slightly better in the sound quality department, but more than double the price, even if you include the price of the adapter. And comfort is more important to me anyway. The sound is more than good enough. I can hear what direction bullets are coming in, that's all that really matters to me.The only complaint I have is I wish the cord was another foot or so longer. Not much more than that because then it would hang down. But even though my tower is only a few feet from me, the cord is still not very loose. It would be slightly better I guess if my tower was on the left side, but still. The cord is obviously short because it is made for plugging into a controller.  Just keep that in mind if it's a deal breaker. It isn't for me thankfully, just an annoyance.

    Love the colour combination, and the coloured wire gives good visibility (no risk of tripping on it). Very good comfort and sound quality, and nice to have a mic built in that can also fold away if you don’t want to use it. They’re very good, and great value, highly recommend.

    I've used various qualities of headphone over the years and, to be fair, some of the cheaper brands have been better than more expensive ones. I'm at an age where headphone quality doesn't quite cover the damage that concerts, discos and live bands have done to my ears.I can say that the sound quality of these headphones is not bad for a cheaper make - their range and clarity is pretty good for the £26-ish that I paid for them. I would not pay more for them, however - I think that £30 would be pushing the bracket a little.The headset also grips tight to my head and doesn't fall off if I move my head suddenly.I haven't been able to test the microphone yet, but I'm not too worried about that.That's the good, but the bad... Well, the build quality feels a bit cheap. I'll give it maybe a year before the plastic starts falling off the ear pads (I'll quite happily admit that I'm wrong if it doesn't!). The extendable arms feel a little too plasticky.This isn't worth a star, however. The thing that lost the one star was the length of the cable - there is no way that anyone playing a PlayStation or other console game would ever want to buy these headphones. The cable comes in at around a meter in length, barely adequate to plug in to my PC monitor. Utterly ridiculous. Also, there are no options to split the output between a unified mic/ear jack and separate mic + ear jacks. Thankfully my monitor has a jack socket in it, otherwise I'd be returning these.

    quando chegou, achei ele pequeno, e realmente ele é bem menor do que os da concorrência. usando ele por umas horas (4/5 horas) vc percebe que ele começa a apertar um pouco a sua cabeça, o áudio achei também bem baixinho e o microfone bem básico, meus amigos reclamam de retorno na voz deles quando uso o fone no volume máximo, e nem é tão MÁXIMO assim, por que como disse, ele é baixo. acho que vale a pena pegar se tiver alguma promoção de aproximadamente R$140 - por que com R$200 vc encontra outros melhores.

    Das Plantronics Blackwire ist angenehm zu tragen - auch über Stunden.  Ich nutze es fast nur zum Telefonieren aus einem Großraumbüro heraus.  Meine Gesprächsteilnehmer hören nichts vom Gewusel um mich herum.  Das active noise cancelation habe ich immer an - ohne klingt es für mich nicht schön.Da ich das Headset jetzt schon seit mehreren Jahren beinahe täglich im Einsatz habe, kann ich auch sagen, dass es sehr robust ist. Microfin und Lautsprecher funktionieren tatellos. Weder Ohrpolster noch der gepolsterte Bügel, der über dem Kopf liegt, haben bisher Schaden genommen.Das Headset ist nicht zum Hören von Musik sicher nicht ideal, aber ich nutze es auch dafür. Selbst Klassik klingt immer noch gut über das Plantronics Blackwire.

    Ce genre de casque manque souvent de basses : ici, on est surpris par le contraire. Les basses sont renforcées, mais les aigus manquent de transparence. Même le son du micro donne un son assez grave : vous ne l’utiliserez pas pour enregistrer pas vos podcasts ou une voix off pour une vidéo. Bref, très bien pour la visio-conférence ou Youtube et, entre deux réunions, pour l’écoute d’un fond musical à faible volume (ça sature si vous poussez trop loin le volume). Ce n’est sûrement pas le casque à employer pour écouter vos disques favoris, mais à ce prix-là, vous vous en doutiez.La qualité de fabrication est satisfaisante : ajustements précis, raccords de câbles qui inspirent confiance.Casque instantanément reconnus par plusieurs systèmes (Windows & Linux) et avec une dénomination claire : on le retrouve facilement parmi les périphériques connectés.Ergonomie : les coussins sont confortables et font à peu près le diamètre de l’oreille. L’arceau ne serre pas trop et l’attache de celui-ci est bien déportée sur l’extérieur des écouteurs. Conséquence: ça reste confortable pendant une utilisation prolongée et, surtout, aucune pression sur les branches de lunettes ! Un bon point.En définitive, un rapport qualité pleinement satisfaisant. Il vaut ses étoiles.

    The Plantronics Blackwire 3220 USB-A Wired Headset is a solid choice for those seeking a dependable, dual-ear headset for professional or personal use. As someone who values clear audio, comfort, and ease of use, I found this headset to be a reliable companion for a variety of tasks.Sound quality is paramount when it comes to headsets, and the Blackwire 3220 doesn't disappoint. The audio is clear, crisp, and free from distortion, making it a great option for conference calls, video meetings, or simply enjoying music or podcasts. The noise-canceling microphone ensures that your voice comes through with clarity, and background noise is effectively minimized.Comfort is another strong suit of this headset. The over-ear design with plush cushioning provides a comfortable fit, even during extended wear. The ear cups swivel and pivot, allowing for a customizable fit, and the adjustable headband ensures that it accommodates various head sizes comfortably. It's lightweight and doesn't exert excessive pressure on the head or ears.

    I work in IT for a Healthcare group. I have my providers use these for our dictation system MModal. They work, its easy to send them straight to providers homes, and theyre cheap. I do find it helps on PCs to install the Plantronics drivers. But other than that small issue I've been very satisfied with these. They plug in and work and make our dictation system much easier to use than the ""Mobile Microphone"" application

    Acheté pour un usage pro pour des appels vidéo cotidiens. C'est vraiment plug&play, je l'ai branché par USB et ça a marché immédiatement sans rien installer.La qualité audio est au top, on entend très clairement, et le micro est super puissant (même un peu trop, il faut vraiment pas parler fort !)C'est très confortable, ça ne serre pas mais ça ne tombe pas non plus, pareil pour les coussinets.Je n'utilise pas tous les contrôles sur le câble, sauf le mute, super pratique en grosse réunion pour pas embêter tout le monde mais pouvoir réactiver la voix quand on veut parler uniquement.Seul bémol est qu'il n'est pas utilisable que sur l'ordi, mais j'ai vu qu'il y a aussi une version un petit peu plus chère avec prise jack pour ce qui préfèrent ça.

    Het product is niet ontworpen door een gebruiker. Links en rechts zitten verkeerd om, en kan niet in Windows worden gewijzigd. De bedieningsmodule bungelt altijd aan het snoer, dus is het zwaar en blijft het haken. Er zit geen clipje op om de module aan kleding vast te maken en daarnaast is het snoer aan de andere kant van bedieningsmodule te kort. Al met al een zeer slecht ontwikkeld product, welke nooit is getest door een echte gebruiker, en dat is jammer want met een paar kleine aanpassingen was het van bijzonder slecht product een goed product geweest.

    This is a great headset for people who spend a lot of time on Zoom/Teams/Meet etc...The clarity of the mic and speakers for speech is excellent, with the headset also being suitable for games and media.The best part about them though is that they don't block out everything around you, so they are easy to wear for lengthy periods.I also have the Plantronics C5220 and they are a great headset too - those ones do block out external noise really well, so if that is what you want, spend the extra for those, but for everyday productivity these 3220's are perfect.

    Usiamo queste cuffie per collegamenti telefonici digitali con i clienti. Il prodotto è valido e funziona bene. Ma ha un difetto che ne abbrevia molto la vita: il filo è troppo sottile e si rovina molto facilmente e velocemente, soprattutto il tratto dal microfono alla cuffia. Basterebbe realizzare il prodotto tutto con un cavo di maggior spessore, almeno come il tratto che va dallo spinotto al microfono.

    Ich nutze dieses Headset im Wesentlichen für Teams-Besprechungen und bin von der Klangqualität absolut begeistert. Warum ein Stern Abzug? Die Steuereinheit sitzt an einer ungünstigen Stelle und so kann es schon mal vorkommen, dass aus Versehen eine Taste gedrückt wird. Mich hat es auf diese Weise schon mehrfach aus Besprechungen geworfen. Ein weiterer Punkt ist, dass es sich nach längerem Tragen an den Ohren unangenehm anfühlt.

    The headset works ok when in Teams meetings. However, when I listen to music or any other audio outside of Teams, the headset will lower the volume. After working with Jabra support for a week, they are finally willing to RMA the headset. However, I have to pay for packaging and shipping before I receive a replacement. My very horrible customer service experience, along with poor performance when using outside of a meeting, leads me to not recommend this or any Jabra product.

    Genau Richtig!Hat mich ein paar Anläufe gekostet. Das Teil ist super. Etwas ""eng"" für meine dicke Rübe - die allermeisten werden damit kein Problem haben. Selbst die dicksten Dick-Köpfe sollten zurecht kommen. Desto größer der Umfang, desto besser wird der passive ANC - Nicht schlecht - Beste Variante für On-Ear Kopfhörer, die ich je hatte.Das Konzept ist Officetauglich, kein Bluetooth = It Flippt nicht aus und keine Alexa oder Siri Integration, der Datenschutz-Roll-Kopf kann weiter schlafen, golfen oder segeln.Luxusfunktionen: Mikrofon nach oben bewegen, die typische Officegeste nach dem Call oder beim Kaffee schlurpen - ""Mutet"" Ansage - Wenn man vergisst es wieder runter zu drehen ""Headset ist noch immer gemutet"" - Gar nicht schlecht angedacht. Nett gelöst.Sonst kein gesabbel von irgendetwas so will man das. Ein bischen nerven zwei DingeDie Bedienung am Headset muss man erstmal raus haben, dann gehts gut. Nervt aber das man mehrere Mutebuttons hat - Zurechtrücken führt immer wieder zum ungewollte Tasten drücken. Nicht optimal, aber so ists heute halt - Dafür hats keinen Brachial-Button-Element, die immer rumnerven - den Preis dafür zahl ich gern - nichts nervte so sehr wie Gigantische Button-Elemente, deren Verkabelung immer im Weg lag zwischen Tastatur, Maus oder am Hals - Da kriechste nen Hals ... So ist es immer noch besser wenn Bluetooth keine Lösung ist.Kabel etwas kurz, aber korrekt. Kann man ja verlängern, machste mit USB Kabel Female / Male Verlängerung.Die Lautstärke läßt sich gut einstellen, paar Klicks fertig. In Kombo mit PC Software sollte es keine Probleme geben. Funzt natürlich auch mit ggf. Adaptern am Handy.  OHNE APP - Das ist der TRICK! Gibt 100 Punkte EXTRA ;>Gibt eine andere Version, die Faltbar ist, die dann mit App läuft - Hatte ich auch, war nur nicht meins und für die Zwecke im Office völlig ungeeignet, aber kann auch nur empfohlen werden für Unterwegs wer On Ear Dinger mag, ich steh da mehr auf In Ear, haste mehr Ruhe und siehst weniger bekloppt aus ;>Empfehlenswert. Wirklich. Traumhaft!Die Konstruktion der Kopfhöhrer sind das beste das ich je in der Hand hatte. Solide nicht brechende Verbindungen, am Kopf das Gummie stört nicht, ist Weich, biegsam, bricht auch nichts. Alles genial und um alles zu toppen hat das Teil den richtig genialen ASMR Sound > Einfach mit dem Finger über den Bügel streichen während du auf den Kunden wartest ... Relax ;>110 % Kaufempfehlung. Vielleicht sogar 180% aber wir wollen mal etwas vorsichtig bleiben :-) Ein bischen Euphorie ist aber nach Jahrzehnten !!! Klapper-Head-Sets verständlich - Endlich ein HEADSET Klapper war gestern! :o)Kaufen! Auch wenns teilweise überzogen teuer ist, bis zu 125 kann man hinlegen. 150 oder mehr finde ich trotz allem unverschämt teuer - Kann da allerdings den Hersteller verstehen, der sich bewußt ist das das ein 1A Produkt ist.

    Ottimo prodotto: se sei invideoconferenza, gli altri non sentono eventuali rumori o parlato attorno a te, ma solo la tua voce: la cancellazione del rumore di fondo funziona bene.Ottima la possibilità di alzare il microfono per metterlo in ""mute"": così è più chiaro, anche per chi hai intorno.Si sente forse troppo poco la propria voce nelle proprie cuffie (gli altri ti sentono bene invece).

    Alors autant vous le dire je ne suis pas fan des casques et encore moins des casques micro et je dois dire que celui est top , tout d'abord il est discret et valorisant ( et oui c'est le petit modèle mais qui n'a rien de ridicule et ne vous rend pas ridicule ) . Que dire d'autre le casque se connecte très bien tout aussi bien sur un PC que sur un MAC, la couche Jabra Directe est plus qu'essentiel pour les mise a jours, et les réglages avancée assez nombreux et facilitant une fois que l'on prend le temps de s'y hasarder ... le micro est d'excellente qualité et filtre très bien les cri et autres bruits que nos plus jeunes peuvent produire en ces temps confinés .... je me surprend même a écouter de la musique avec ce casque tellement le son est finalement riche et tout à la fois équilibré et agréable ... bref un must have découvert pour des raisons de télétravail et que je vais conserver dans le futur ...

    Avevo le Jabra 40, la versione precedente, sempre mono auricolare, queste sono veramente un altra cosa, sia come materiale, dove si percepisce una migliore qualita' delle plastica, sia come vestibilita', in quanto aderiscono meglio al capo. Il fatto di avere tutti i controlli nella cuffia e' molto comodo.Dal punto di vista del funzionamento sono molto meglio delle precedenti e anche i miei interlocutori che ho interpellato confermano una migliore audibilita' dovuta al microfono di nuova concezione.Grazie

    These headphones will tell you to ""lower microphone to unmute"" every couple of minutes or so, no matter what position the microphone is in. They will also change randomly between two EQ settings; one somewhat muted, one clear. Even with the best of intentions, I can't call these things features - they are bugs in a poorly designed and ultimately disappointing product.

    Probably the 6th or 7th pair in the last few years. Have not found another headphone which works as well, so we have so far kept with the same brand, but the cables are very soft plastic and get destroyed often. One pair got destroyed while traveling, the ear piece fell off, all the others had cable issues after being chewed on.

    Seit der Rückkehr in die Büros hatte ich häufig Beschwerden, dass man meine lauten Sitznachbarn hört. Deshalb habe ich dieses Headset gekauft und muss sagen, dass ich sehr zufrieden bin. Meine Gesprächspartner hören mich jetzt gut und das Headset ist bequem.PS: Wenn die Jabra Software installiert ist, hat man am Anfang das Gefühl, man hört sich selbst. Das ist eine Funktion die aktiviert ist, damit sich das Sprechen natürlicher anfühlt. Mir persönlich hat das nicht so gefallen, aber das lässt sich recht einfach in der Software deaktivieren.

    Wenn man primär im Home Office arbeitet und viel telefonieren muss, dann sollte man sich nicht immer das günstigste Headset kaufen. Aus diesem Grund griff ich zu dem ""Jabra Evolve2 40"" mit USB-Kabel, wenn auch mir ein kabelloses lieber wäre. Dank USB-Hub auf dem Tisch, ist dies aber das kleinste Problem.+ Gute Soundqualität: Meine Gesprächspartner können mich sehr gut verstehen, umgekehrt kann ich dank großer Ohrmuschel ebenfalls alles gut verstehen.Als Brillenträger wird man jedoch eventuell Probleme bekommen. Nach einigen Minuten wird das Tragen unangenehm, da der Brillenbügel angedrückt wird und dadurch leichte Schmerzen verursacht. Mit Kontaktlinsen oder sehr dünnen Brillengestellen gibt's kaum Probleme.Unter Linux wurde das Headset problemlos erkannt und kann mit ALSA / Pulseaudio direkt verwendet werden. Ich setze es u.a. für Meetings sowie Telefonie über SwyxIt! ein. Letzteres ist in einer Windows VM installiert.

    Ho preso queste cuffie perché a lavoro uso Microsoft Teams e le mie vecchie cuffie (JBL e55bt) producevano un sibilo in sottofondo che mi costringeva a mutarmi se non stavo parlando.Il fatto che le cuffie siano cablate non è un gran downgrade per l'uso che ne faccio, anzi apprezzo molto il led sulla presa USB che segnala quando sono in mute.Le cuffie sono veramente comode per l'utilizzo nelle call, si può rispondere abbassando il microfono, ci sono i comandi del volume sul padiglione destro, un tasto per mutare ridondante, premendo sul padiglione si può rispondere e terminare le chiamate.Il comfort mentre le indosso è contrastante: l'isolamento è buono per non essere a cancellazione attiva del rumore, ma le cuffie over-ear come queste tendono a scaldare molto l'orecchio e questo modello specifico mi da l'impressione di poca stabilità. Certo non è un caso d'uso tipico, ma se agito un po' la testa le cuffie cadono con facilità.I problemi vengono fuori appena si esce dall'utilizzo per cui sono state create queste cuffie (non si può quindi fargliene una colpa): la resa audio mentre ascolto la musica non mi è piaciuta per niente, le JBL che avevo prima sono un altro pianeta.Nei prossimi giorni deciderò se tenerle, sono molto dubbioso per la resa con la musica e per l'indossabilità. Probabilmente conviene spendere di più per avere delle cuffie perfette, valuterò se vale la pena fare questa spesa.EDIT: Alzo la valutazione da 4 a 5 stelle.Ho usato queste cuffie per una settimana e mi sono convinto a tenerle. Sono semplicemente comode per lavorare, forse leggermente costose ma funzionano veramente bene. Se premo il pulsate sul lato Teams viene portato in primo piano, posso rispondere abbassando il microfono, i led ""occupato"" funzionano benissimo. Una funzionalità che avevo sottovalutato è la riproduzione dell'audio del microfono in cuffia: la latenza è inesistente ed è comodo perché sentendo la nostra voce possiamo adeguare il tono di conseguenza, evitando di urlare nella stanza. Peccato per l'audio, ma se dovrò ascoltare musica o giocare userò le vecchie cuffie.

    Estos headsets son super pesados y bloquean tanto el canal auditivo que parece que aumenta la presión en el oído externo hasta ser insoportable o por lo menos bastante molesto. No lo recomiendo para trabajo o diversión. Además, es muy incómodo no poder escuchar tu propia voz cuando hablas debido a ese cierre hermético incómodo del headset. Debo decir en su favor que el material de fabricación es excelente y que lucen muy durables y confiables. Espero que puedan corregir estos inconvenientes mencionados.

    I've thoroughly road tested these by taking work calls in some challenging situations, and they've performed perfectly:- Backstage at a music festival whilst they were doing a soundcheck, less than 5 meters from the sound system- On a building site on the other side of a wall that someone was drilling intoIn both scenarios, plus many more every day ones, the people I've been talking to have not experienced any sound interruption and had no idea that I was taking a call from such a noisy environment. All they heard was my voice, and no background noise.I'd recommend these to everyone.

    Good quality product that works well on Windows 10. Sound quality is very good. Integration with MS Teams is good and useful.Some negatives that prevent 5 stars:1) the mic is a bit flimsy and perhaps a bit closer to my face than I'd like.2) Cable is too short really.3) personally I'd prefer a mute button on the cable rather than on the headset.

    Das Headset sieht wirklich sehr modern aus, damit kann man sich in einer Videokonferenz sehen lassen.Die Klangqualität ist über alle Zweifel erhaben - nicht nur hört man seine Gesprächspartner in bester Qualität, auch zum Musikhören sind sie hervorragend geeignet. Wirklich eine tolle Klangqualität, das macht Spaß.Die Sprachqualität, die das Mikrofon dem Gesprächspartnern liefert, ist laut deren Rückmeldung ebenfalls sehr gut. Hintergrundgeräusche werden offenbar gut herausgefiltert, ohne zu Verzerrungen zu führen.Die Geräuschunterdrückung bei den Ohrhörern findet - wie beschrieben - lediglich passiv statt. Das heißt, das Headset sitzt mit einem gewissen Anpressdruck auf den Ohren. Die Polster aus Memory-Schaum passen sich der Ohrform gut an und schirmen das Ohr somit gut gegenüber den äußeren Geräuschen ab. Davon darf man sich jedoch keine Wunder versprechen - wer wirklich in einer lauten Geräuschkulisse arbeitet, der sollte über ein Modell mit aktivem Noise-Cancelling nachdenken. Diese passive Lösung dämpft die Umgebungsgeräusche lediglich etwas ab. Was diese Technik verspricht, das hält dieses aber Headset auch.Der Tragekomfort ist prinzipiell gut. Allerdings muss einem klar sein, dass die On-Ear-Bauform einen gewissen Druck auf die Ohren ausübt. Das ist nicht überdurchschnittlich stark, zudem für das passive Noise-Cancelling erforderlich - jedoch empfinde ich ein längeres Tragen (über 90 Minuten am Stück) durchaus als nicht so angenehm - dann muss eine Pause her. Im Sommer könnte es auch recht warm unter der Polstern werden. Hier wären Over-Ear-Modelle vermutlich die angenehmere Lösung. Dies liegt jedoch nicht an einer schlechten Konstruktion dieses Modells sondern den grundsätzlichen Einschränkungen, die diese Bauform mit sich bringt.Ich nutze die Stereo-Variante - bei der Mono-Variante (nur ein Ohrhörer) könnte ich mir gut vorstellen, dass das Gewicht für eine einseitige Lastverteilung unangenehm auffällt. Da wäre ich vorsichtig.Zu den Features: Die Knöpfe für die Musik-Steuerung habe ich bislang nicht benötigt. Die Mute-Funktion unterliegt leider Einschränkungen: Bügel hoch zum Stummschalten funktioniert, die Taste jedoch nicht. Auch die Mute-LED im USB-Stecker funktioniert leider nicht. Laut Service müssen diese speziellen Funktionen von der jeweiligen Soft-Phone-Lösung unterstützt werden. Bei GoToMeeting ist dies offenbar nicht der Fall. Technisch verstehe ich das nur bedingt, da die Stummschaltung über das Headset erfolgt. Auch das Busylight bleibt bei mir dunkel - hier wäre ebenfalls eine Unterstützung durch die Soft-Phone-Lösung erforderlich. Schade. Gut dagegen, dass man seine eigene Stimme in die Ohrhörer einblenden kann - sogar mit Lautstärkeregelung. Das verbessert das eigene Sprachgefühl deutlich und ist nicht selbstverständlich.Die mitgelieferte Tasche ist nett, aber unpraktisch: Durch die Verschlussform ist das Headset etwas friemelig hinein und heraus zu bekommen. Aber besser als nichts.Fazit: Das Headset bietet eine gute Qualität. Beim Tragekomfort sollte man wissen, was für eine Bauform einem persönlich liegt. Die Zusatzfunktionen sind trotz App leider nur eingeschränkt nutzbar, worauf im Werbetext nicht hingewiesen wird.  Damit wird der fünfte Stern für mich knapp verfehlt. Dennoch bin ich zufrieden und werde es behalten.

    Nachdem wir ein Logitech Headset ausprobiert haben, das weder in Sachen Akustik noch Tragekomfort einem kompletten Tag Home Uni genügt hat, mußte ein wertigeres Headset her. Es sollte kabelgebundenen sein, also entschieden wir für uns Jabra. Wir haben bereits Wireless Headsets als auch Wireless Kopfhörer von Jabra im Einsatz. Mit diesem Headset kann man auch einen kompletten Tag Home Uni abarbeiten. Die Akustik ist sehr gut, der Tragekomfort mit den weichen Kunstlederverkleidungen der Ohrmuscheln ist angenehm. Bei größeren Kopfumfängen könnte ich mir vorstellen, dass das Headset etwas spannend auf dem Kopf sitzt. Das Headset ist auf alle Fälle eine Kaufempfehlung.

    Vorweg: Es handelt sich um ein sehr angenehm zu tragendes Headset, optimiert für einen komfortablen Sitz über den ganzen Arbeitstag. Der Preis ist ziemlich hoch für ein kabelgebundenes Headset, aber es ist eben ein professionelles Arbeitsgerät mit hoher Qualität. So weit - so gut.Gekauft habe ich dieses Headset um mit meinem Mobiltelefon, einem Galaxy S21ultra, über ein professionelles, verkabeltes Headset telefonieren zu können. Abgelöst werden sollte ein inzwischen in die Jahre gekommenes GN Biz Headset, dass über mehrere Adapter von QD auf Klinke und dann von Klinke auf USB-C am Samsung hängt.Ich habe mir also überlegt ein professionelles USB-C Headset zu kaufen, das schien mir besser als eine Kette von Adaptern zu sein. Mit GN sehr zufrieden bin ich also bei diesem GN/Jabra Headset gelandet.Dass das Headset mit meinem Handy kompatibel ist habe ich im Vorfeld auf der Jabra Homepage geprüft.Aber: Denkste. Das Headset kommt, ich schließe es ans Handy an und ich höre Alienstimmen. Der Klang ist unglaublich verzerrt, dunkel, kratzend. Der Ton ist nicht ein bisschen schlecht, es funktioniert nicht. Egal ob Telefon oder Medien - das Handy kommt ganz offensichtlich so garnicht mit dem Headset klar.Kaputt? Ne, am PC funktioniert das Headset einwandfrei.An einem anderen Galaxy Telefon: genau das selbe!Auch ein Firmwareupdate des Headsets bringt da nix (ja ... ein Headset hat eine Firmware, und ja die kann man aktualisieren .....).Was tun? Support anrufen! Der teilt mir freundlich mit, dass Handys sowieso immer ein Problem sind und sie mein Handy, ein Samsung S21, leider nicht findet, ob ich mir denn sicher bin dass mein Modell wirklich so heißt. Da sie absolut keine Chance hatte in ihrem Kompatibilitätsleitfaden eine Information zu meinem Telefon zu finden hat sie eben ein Ticket aufgenommen.Antwort von Jabra: Das Headset ist mit meinem Telefon kompatibel, und da es am PC funktioniert ist es auch in Ordnung. Wenn ich dazu noch fragen habe ... soll ich doch Samsung fragen.Das Problem tritt aber bei jedem Samsung auf, dass ich in den Fingern hatte. Ich gehe daher davon aus, dass das Headset eben doch nicht mit Samsung kompatibel ist. Okay, ärgerlich wenn die Website mir vorher was anderes erzählt - kann aber passieren.Überraschend, dass es für ein Telefonheadset überhaupt einen Grund geben kann den Support zu kontaktieren. Enttäuschend, wenn der Support - ohne jede weitere Nachfrage - beschließt, dass ich doch bitte jemand anders nerven soll.Ich werde jetzt nach Jahrzehnten ausprobieren, wie gut man mit Plantronics telefonieren kann!

    Son unos auriculares de diadema pequeñitos, bastante ligeros e ideados principalmente para call centers. Voy a ir punto por punto explicándolos:En cuanto al diseño, son pequeñitos como ya os he dicho, quizás incluso demasiado. No llegan a cubrir la oreja completa, ya que tienen un diseño ''over ear''. Su construcción es principalmente plástico de buena calidad y en la parte de la diadema hay una especie de goma moldeable. El cable es bastante largo y no te dará problemas aunque lo conectes en la zona trasera del pc.Respecto a la comodidad, a mi no me han parecido muy cómodos. Son muy pequeños para mi y no me sujetan bien, además de que a las 2 horas de estar usándolos los noto muy incómodos y me los tengo que quitar. Quizás a alguien que tenga la cabeza más pequeña le pueda venir bien pero a mi me parecen bastante incómodos.En relación a la calidad de sonido, están bien. No tienen la mejor calidad de sonido del planeta y por 100€ encuentras alternativas que se escuchen mejor que esta, con mejores graves y agudos pero es que estos auriculares no están enfocados a eso. Tienen muy buen aislamiento del exterior pese a su tamaño y prácticamente solo escuchas  la conversación o lo que sea que oigas.Con respecto a su conector, utiliza un usb-a de toda la vida. Pienso que habría sido mejor que tuviese un jack y que además trajese un adaptador de jack a usb-a, de esta forma podrías usarlo en el móvil, tablet... o incluso utilizar usb-c que cada vez lo están incluyendo más dispositivos. Desde mi punto de vista, que estén fabricados con un usb-a como único conector es una desventaja importante.En cuanto al micrófono, es algo donde sí he notado calidad aunque echo en falta un filtro anti pop integrado. Supuestamente trae 3 micrófonos en el palito de forma que consigue eliminar parte del ruido ambiental. Esto no lo he podido probar muy a fondo pero si que me ha parecido que algo de ruido consigue eliminar. Un dato curioso es que al levantar el palito el micrófono arriba, este se ''mutea'' de forma que con quien estés en llamada ya no te va a escuchar. Esto puede ser muy útil en call centers.Extras: trae una bolsita de transporte (ver foto adjunta) para que te lo lleves donde sea que lo vayas a utilizar. Esto puede ser útil si los vas a usar en el trabajo, casa...Conclusión. Son unos auriculares enfocados a un público bastante exclusivo, aquellos que trabajen en call centers o que estén mucho tiempo realizando videollamadas y tengan micrófonos y altavoces de baja calidad pues con esto ya tienes un 2 en 1.Si este no es tu caso, creo que es mejor que te busques otra alternativa pues por los 100€ que cuestan, hay otros cascos con mejor calidad de sonido.Un saludo a todos y muchas gracias por leerme, espero haberos sido útil :)

    Das Jabra Evolve2 sitzt sehr angenehm und hat eine gute Tonqualität. Da ich gegenüber eine Baustelle habe, hab ich explizit nach einem Headset mit Noise Canceling gesucht, damit ich bei Besprechungen ungestört der Unterhaltung folgen kann. Leider ist aber jedes Nebengeräusch nach wie vor zu hören, was auch einleuchtet, wenn man die Ohrmuscheln ansieht, welche lediglich aufliegen und das Ohr nicht umschließen.Aber abgesehen von einer irreführenden Beschreibung wirklich ein gutes Headset.P.S. das USB Kabel könnte etwas länger sein...

    Materially this feels pretty nice. The cable is shortish, so you can't go wandering around your office with these on - but on the other hand you don't get tangled up in masses of cable. I may have a fat head, because on maximum extension these only just fit me. It comes with a little thin soft foam bag, which keeps it from getting knocked around in your laptop bag.The fancy features like lifting/lowering the mic to mute/unmute, and all the LEDs, only work in very specific apps even if you install the Jabra Direct software. In Google Meets those features definitely don't work (Jabra support say that Google needs to support ""RCC"") and instead it acts like a dumb headset and you have to click the on-screen mute button like an animal. In Zoom the fancy features work.It also works fine for playing music.

    Got this to replace my wired Plantronics C520 and I wonder why I waited this long to get a wireless headset. It's easy to use and very good sound quality.PROS:* USB-C or USB-A models available (both the PC bluetooth dongle and charging station use USB-C on my model and are USB-A on other models)* Great sound with good noise cancellation that helps drown out my AC* Automatic integration with Windows 10 without installing any special software* Easy to pair with the PC bluetooth dongle (mine is USB-C) and my iPhone 13* Easy on/off switch to conserve battery and convenient charging stand* Automatically repairs with BOTH the PC dongle (Win10) and my iPhone when turning the headset on and I can payback from EITHER without having to switch or repair anything! I Love this feature* Volume/Pause/Play/Skip/Mute and on/off buttons on headset* Works with Zoom and Teams to answer/hangup/mute/unmute calls & meetings (Note: mine is NOT the ""Teams"" model so Teams has to already be running)* Can use the headset when plugged into USB power when battery is low* Can use the headset without the bluetooth dongle like a regular wired headset when the headset is plugged directly into a PC USB port.* USB-C model will work with PCs or charging ports that only have USB-A ports if you buy some cheap USB-C female to USB-A male adapters.* Great range on the bluetooth dongle (anywhere in my 2-story 1800sqft house and most of my 1/4 acre property including outbuildings). I find I can increase the reception by plugging the USB dongle into a USB extension cable and mounting it higher up rather than just plugging into the side of my laptop/docking station.CONS:* Wish the volume could go a bit louder, especially in Teams calls, but it's still plenty loud, especially when playing music.* Wish I could swap the Right/Left sound so I can use the microphone on the left side instead of the right side (which you can still do if you don't mind hearing stereo sound come out the wrong earpieces)* Wish I could turn off the annoying phrases the headset says to me when I use it (""Power on"", ""Battery high"", ""PC connected"", ""Pairing"", ""Phone connected"", ""Volume Maximum"", ""Mute on"", ""Mute off"", ""Power off"", etc.), but at least it's usually drowned out by the louder audio content. [Edit: Apparently you can change the Mute/Volume phrases to be tones by downloading the smartphone app, but not the other phrases]* If you buy the USB-C model and your PC has limited USB-C ports (or the port is covered by a docking station like mine is), you may need to order some cheap USB-C to USB-A adapters so you can use any USB-A port or power source for the bluetooth dongle and/or charging station.* Documentation included in the package is abysmal (only a simple ""Start Here"" tag attached to the headset with a couple diagrams). Had to download the manual to figure out how to connect and use when I first got it.* Some models don't include the charging station so make sure you get the right one* A bit pricier than similar models.BOTTOM LINE: I highly recommend this headset for anyone who wants to replace their wired headset used for meetings/calls or who wants to listen to music from their PC or phone without having to constantly re-pair devices.

    Super Headset und sieht schick aus.Mikrofon: Via Smartphone ist die Qualität vom Mikrofon nicht vom Original Mikrofon am Smartphone zu unterscheiden. Am Computer jedoch, ist das Mikrofon sehr leise. Der am anderen Ende der Leitung muss also die Lautstärke dementsprechend lauter machen.Sound im allgemeinen: Die Soundqualität ist hervorragend. Jedoch stört mich, das die Frau, wenn man das HS anmacht immer spricht.Akku: Der Akku hält durch und mit der Praktischen Aufladestation, kann Sie über Nacht problemlos geladen werden.Tragekomfort: Sie sitzen sehr angenehm auf den Ohren.

    Since 2020, I have been trying to find a suitable headset or headphones to utilize for remote work.I’ve tried wired headsets, wireless Bluetooth earbuds, and a few wireless headsets. This headset is far and away the best one I’ve used and I’m glad I have finally settled on a headset to keep.Pros- physical mute button on mic arm; seamlessly integrated with Zoom- ability to connect to Bluetooth source and PC source simultaneously- stand/charging dock is well made and sturdy- comfort, even after several hours of usage, no fatigue- wireless range, seems to work even from far away, I can leave my desk to go to the kitchen and not lose connectivityMy favorite feature is how seamless it switches between Bluetooth audio on my iPhone (Spotify / Apple Music) to Zoom when I need to join a call. Launching the Zoom meeting immediately switches the headset to Zoom and you get an audio notification “microphone muted”.I don’t see any true downsides or “cons” to this headset. Maybe it’s pricier than some other brands, but you’re getting an enterprise quality headset as a result.

    Tägliche stundenlange Meetings mit diesem 162 Gramm leichten kabellosen beidohrig unaufdringlich ohraufliegendem Poly-Headset sind kein Problem. Die USB-C-Version mit dem Bluetooth 5.2 ist sehr stabil und funktioniert sogar noch sehr gut, wenn ich samt Headset die Zimmer wechsel und 2 Mauern zwischen dem Headset und dem USB-C-PC-Dongle oder dem Smartphone sind.Negativ: Beim Einschalten vom Headset wird eine 3 Sekunden lange nervende Sprachansage abgespielt, die sich nicht ausschalten lässt und dem Headset-Träger die Information bringt, dass das Headset nun eingeschaltet ist. Die Möglichkeit wie zum Beispiel bei vielen In-Ear-Buds bei einem Telefonanruf die Buds einfach aus der Ladeschale holen und in die Ohren einsetzen und das Telefongespräch sofort beginnen, gibt es mit diesem Headset und dessen Sprachansage nicht. Wer denkt sich solchen Zwang-Sprachansagen-Mist aus?

    I've had this thing for just under 2 years now, and had tried no less than 6 other headsets of all different brands before this.  In the end, they all sucked in one way or another, this one worked half-decently, and I was just too tired to keep looking.I should note that I use this mostly to connect to my Macbook Pro, for conference calls on Teams, and to listen to music and movies on my computer...First, the good: The headset is pretty comfortable (nice padding) and lightweight, and the battery life is great.  I'm on this thing nonstop all day long, and have never come close to running out of battery.  And the range is as good as any Bluetooth headset available.  Sound quality is not going to impress anybody, but it's not bad, and fine for my purposes (bass is better than most when listening to music).  And the noise canceling works fairly well...I have a super-clicky keyboard, and nobody ever knows I'm even typing, although some small part of this is also down to the software noise canceling built into meeting apps like Teams.  I preferred this headset over its big brother, which has a short, solid boom mike, because I wanted to be able to position the mic right in front of my mouth.But the bad...The mute button, the MOST IMPORTANT BUTTON, worked for about 2 months after I got it, then worked intermittently for about another month.  Then hasn't worked at all.  This makes it nearly impossible to walk around the house while on a call... I either have to leave the mic on and hope I don't make any noise, or I have to run back to my computer every time I need to talk.  This is endlessly frustrating.Connectivity also sucks.  I keep the thing fully updated with all the firmware updates, but in the last 4 or so months, I have many issues where the headset shows as being connected, but no sound comes through.  I have to fiddle with all the components, turning the headset and the computer settings on and off for several minutes to get it working, and sometimes sound will come through for 2 seconds before cutting out again.  I am a software coder and have built lots of computers, so this is not a problem of a luddite having issues with tech.  I thought for a while that it was due to my 5 year old Macbook, but I just recently got a brand new MacBook Pro with M3 Max, and the problem persists.Plantronics used to be top-of-the-line for this type of equipment.  Those days are long gone.  Stay away.

    I've been using this headset every day for almost 2 years now and it's nearly perfect. Working from home i needed the noise canceling feature and this headset to keep the clients from knowing I'm sitting on my porch in the woods and this did the trick. The battery life on this is great, I'm able to work an entire shift with zero issues. As much as I use and abuse this thing it still keeps working and if I do ever figure out a way to break it I will probably buy this exact same one. The only complaint I have is the lack of bass in the line out but this isn't a headset for recording studio quality audio... it's for work.

    I don't know how they did it but these have incredible microphone isolation! I have been on the phone using this headset and someone has walked in to talk to me and the person on the phone with me cannot hear them. I also frequently have my TV and a fan running. The person on the other end cannot hear either. I also love that when I'm using an app I can mute (on the mic arm) and it doesn't detect that I have muted. My only con is that I use these for many hours during the day and my ears get tired but overall the headset is very comfortable. Also, the charge holds for a very long time and the sound is very clear. I frequently have to turn down the volume because I hear too much on the other end of the call! My daughter also purchased these and uses at work in a shared office and has been very happy with them. I hear from people I speak with that my voice is very clear. I tend to put the mic close to my mouth and away from my nose so my breathing isn't heard.

    My team loves the Voyager 4320 UC wireless headset that I got them.  I personally have one and have been using the same model for over a year now, although it's a USB-A version and not the newer USB-C version, all functions are the same. The feedback I got from all my 6 guys were positive, easy to use, easy to update, easy to set-up, clear sound, and 0 distortion. The volume button is easy to operate, and the center ""Alexa/Siri"" function is a plus to some that uses it. The headset is very comfortable, the heads of my team differs from one another. Some are wider than normal, some are just wide and a couple of narrow ones. The USB-C easily connects with their Surface tablet for easy charging when working away from their desks.  All of us love the quick docking charger with charging light indicator. Overall, it's an easy to operate headset.

    I ordered this headset on Dec. 30, 2021, sold by BTE Computer Inc through Amazon.ca.  No Provincial sales tax was charged on the purchased (only GST), requiring my business to self-assess the RST sales tax and forward to Manitoba Finance when I next filed my next RST return.  The headset was delivered punctually and well packaged on January 12, 2022.I ordered the USB-C version of this product.  It comes with a 5.2 Bluetooth Adapter that plugs into the USB-C slot of my Windows 10 computer to pair the headset. When plugged in, the Poly software displays that the adapter is plugged in, and the Voyager 4320 Headphone plays a message that the computer is connected, however the Poly software shows the headset itself as being disconnected even though the power is on and the connected message was heard from the headphones.  In this disconnected state, the headphones do not show up on the computer’s Sound Playback output device selection menu on my taskbar, nor do the Poly drivers show up in the BT700 module in the Device Manager.  A reboot is required to make this happen.  Similarly, if the adapter is unplugged briefly, perhaps to use the computer USB-C input port to plug in the headphone charging station, once you plug the adapter in again, a reboot is once again required to register the device in order to use it on the computer.  Device and software updates have not corrected this problem.  I have not tried using the headphones on a different computer to determine if this problem is device specific.  (see attached photos).This headset comes in both USB-A and USB-C options.  When I ordered this product, I couldn’t find clear documentation to indicate which USB standard the USB-A headphone option used (ie:  USB 2.1, USB 3.0, USB 3.1, etc).  Wanting a newer technology, I opted for the USB-C headset not fully understanding that my computer required two unique USB-C ports, not just one.  The USB-C Bluetooth Adapter requires one port, and the Plantronics Charge Stand requires a 2nd USB-C ports.  Sadly, my work computer only has ONE USB-C port, so I am limited to using either the adapter or the charger but not both.  I wish the documentation was clearer on that point as clearly I missed reading it before ordering this product and would have chosen the USB-A option had I known about this in advance.  Since a reboot is required each time the USB-C Bluetooth adapter is plugged in, swapping out the Bluetooth adapter daily to plug in the charge cradle is simply not an option I can contend with.  As a result, I have been forced to use a USB-C cellphone charger to charge my headphones while the charge stand remains unused, acting as a dust collector stored behind my monitor.  It would have been nice if Poly provided a USB-C to USB-A adapter for the charging unit for situations like mine so that the product can be used out of the box vs having to now research and order this type of adapter in order to use the product (I still haven’t ordered one).I have used these headphones with both my cellphone and computer.  Sound quality is good, and they are relatively comfortable to wear for several hours at a time if you can tolerate light pressure on your ears.  They do have a tendency to fall off your head if you bend forward, so care is required during these movements.  The mic sound is clear, although I was told that the reception was clearer when talking through the VOIP on my computer vs using the VOIP on my cellphone.  When the mic boom is in the up position, the surrounding sounds are muffled but still heard by the recipient.  The mute button on the mic boom works very well and is in a good location.  The headset, by default, is on the right side of your head matching the Right headset (labeled R).  The boom can be swung around to use on the left side of your head. In this case, the headset will be worn rotated 180 degrees with the Right label ear on the Left side of your head and vice-versa.  Sound quality for music is reasonable for a headset designed for a call centre.When connected to the USB-C port at the back of my desktop computer located under my metal office desk, the Bluetooth range is only a mere 24 feet before the signal starts breaking up (the joys of having a metal desk, LOL).  When paired to my cellphone, the range is excellent, allowing me to walk through almost my entire home (upstairs and downstairs) while my cellphone was left on my office desk.  I’ve notice interference when within 3 feet of my kitchen microwave oven when it is powered on; the software has no options to change frequencies to prevent this.Overall, it is a decent entry level office headphone.  I would give it a 5 rating if I didn’t have to reboot the computer every time the USB-C Bluetooth adapter was pulled out and re-inserted, and if it came with an optional USB-C to USB-A adapter for those of us who only have one USB-C port on their computers.

    Es ist schon zum Verzweifeln. Nach langem Ausprobieren verschiedener Headsets war ich mir sicher, dass das 4320 die Nachteile des Poly Voyager Focus 2 (wenig sinnvolles ANC auf den offenen Kopfhörern, starrer Mikrofonarm und unbequemes Kopfband) mit seinen Vorteilen (für Bluetooth sehr hohe Reichweite, guter Klang, praktische Ladestation) verbinden würde.Und ja, das tut es auch. Es ist in vielen Belangen eine gute, teils sogar schlauere und deutlich günstigere Alternative zum Topmodell. Es lässt sich sehr bequem und sicher auf dem Kopf tragen (verglichen mit etwa dem Jabra Evolve2 65, das mir bei der leichtesten Kopfneigung schon runter rutscht), klingt für Musik ausreichend bis gut und bietet eine wirklich gute Mikrofon-ANC, die Alltagsgeräusche wie Kaffee kochen oder Schreibtisch umräumen gut herausfiltert.Wegen des schlechten Feedbacks meiner Gesprächspartner geht es trotzdem leider wieder zurück. Mir wurde trotz des einstellbaren Mikrofonarms, mit dem ich das Mikro bis auf 2 cm an meinen Mundwinkel bringen kann, durch die Bank eine leise, wenn auch gute Sprachwiedergabe bescheinigt. Das größte Problem ist aber, dass das Mikrofon sehr windempfindlich ist und kein Schaumstoff-Windschutz vorhanden ist. Ein Schritt ans offene Fenster oder gar vor die Tür ist sofort hörbar, und das Ärgerlichste: Ich muss gezielt am Mikro vorbei atmen, um nicht ständig hörbare Atemgeräusche zu produzieren.Warum das nicht viel öfter kritisiert wird? Ich vermute, dass die meisten Anwender das Gerät unter einem Betriebssystem oder mit einer Kommunikationsplattform verwenden, die dynamisch einen Mikrofonverstärker zuschalten. In der bei mir üblichen Kombi Linux+BigBlueButton ist das leider nicht möglich.

    I purchased these to replace an old Jabra headset that broke. I received my headset yesterday so today (Monday) was my first time using them for work.Issues:The Bluetooth adapter works for some but for me it caused problems.  When I plugged it into my laptop I noticed that my headset did in fact connect but each time I tried to join a MS Teams meeting I either couldn't hear or my team couldn't hear me.  This was resolved simply by pairing my headset with my laptop without the adapter. Once I joined my meetings everyone said I sounded very clear.Music:I tried listening to music and found the sound was better than I expected. I could surprisingly could hear the bass in my music.Cellphone Use:I tried my headset on both my cell phones (an iPhone and a S21).  Both sounded fine.  Everyone said they could hear my loud and clear.Overall I am satisfied with my purchase. Rhese headphones were comfortable and i had no issues wearing them for hours at a time.  If my experience changes I will post an update.

    I've tried a few headsets, including another Plantronics wireless but unless the connection is 100% perfect everyone has a hard time hearing me and can usually hear the background noises over my voice. I should have just purchases this from the beginning. The sound quality of the mic is excellent and it is well-designed. The only downside is that I know I'll get tired of wearing it dor an extended period but my head is larger than most so I have that problem with every headset I have tried. But the re-connection from the base is fast enough that I can put it on the base when not using it.

    as the title states,  I was very pleasantly surprised with these headsets.  I own several bluetooth headset that I have been using in my daily professional life,  and have recently been on Very long conference calls which makes the Bluetooth headsets uncomfortable on the ears and head after extended wear.these headsets have a awesome battery life,  an awesome range from the computer that it is attached to and very comfortable on the ears and head after 6-10 hours of use.So I would very much recommend these to anyone that has to be on a Long conferenced call.

    For the first six weeks I loved them. They are comfortable, easy to set up and use. My wife and I share an office and the noise cancelation kept people on my calls from hearing her. Then, the microphone began working sporadically. I tried removing the device then reconnecting and it worked for a while then stopped again. I connected to my phone and had the same problems. I've had to purchase a wired headset instead. At this point these were a waste of money.

    In 2023, it's absolutely stupid that this mic doesn't have a mute on/off light indicator.By default, it's just a beep so you're not even sure if the mic is on or off. Most workplaces now, doesn't allow the installation of 3rd party applications so I can't even download and install the software to enable mute on/off voice indicator.Very, very disappointed for such a big name branded product that costs $100+

    Contacted company several times to troubleshoot issues. Tried all fixes, asked for warranty repair. They contact me often to get up accounts on their site. I jump through all hoops, register device — they can’t see it. I do it all over with another email  They can’t see it. Although they have a copy of my receipt two months later. Device not working, warranty now expired .. headset tossed in garbage.  If you are a professional. Don’t waste your time.  I had so many emails.. just send us your address and we will send a replacement, then f/u email.. please create an account.

    These Poly - Voyager 4320 UC Wireless Headset + Charge Stand (Plantronics) headphones were a much needed upgrade from my old Plantronics headset that my company gave for work. They are super comfortable to wear and are really padded in the ear area. Though I will say that the padding took some getting used to since my old plantronics had basically no padding at all. But now that I have gotten used to the padding I wouldn’t go back!Both outgoing and receiving sound quality is great! I have had absolutely no issues with the sound quality at all. I have asked several co-workers and have even had not one, but two of them ask me what I was using because I sounded so good! The receiving sound is just as nice and it is easy to hear and crystal clear.I will say I don’t get anywhere near the stated wireless area. I go from one level to another in my home which is maybe 15-20 feet and sometimes it will start cutting out. I see some suggestions on here to help with this so hopefully I can get that worked out. But overall I’m pretty happy with these! Sound quality is great. The fit is super comfortable, and the quality is what you would expect from the brand which is well made with good materials. There made to be used daily and should last a long time even with constant use!

    I recently got this headset for occasional meetings that may last all day long. First of all, I am very impressed with the battery life. I always keep it charging whenever I finish my calls, and the headset always worked just fine. The earpad is very comfy, so I don't feel any pain from wearing this headset. The sound quality is good, and the speaker works just fine. The only concern that I may mention is the range - it works okay if I work on the same floor. Whenever I have to go up to the second floor, the signal becomes weak, and I have to promptly come down.Overall, I am satisfied with this headset and definitely recommend it. I just hope that the range could be improved.

    If like me you have 6 existing headsets and wanted to add another 2, please be aware you will need to do a firmware update through Hollylands website before your system will allow a total of 8 headsets paired.Every single one of your 6 existing headsets will need to be updated. Search for Hollyland V1.0.4.3 to find the patch.Once you do get these paired, you are laughing - terrific quality, great for live event comms.

    I've been using this comms system for over 2 months now and I've been extremely impressed. Compared to other much more expensive solutions, I expected the quality to be signifcantly worse but the Hollyland set has been the same if not better than systems I've used previously that were double the price. It's been super refreshing to just be able to slide a battery in and flick the power switch and have a 6 person comms system going in less than 2 minutes. The sound quality is exception and I've been able to get the 300m range as advertised. My only complaint is once you get over about 350m the signal does drop out and needs you to walk back into range about 280m before the connection resumes. However I can't really fault the product as it already performs beyond as advertised and you can clearly hear the single slowly failing and you know the limit. The battery system is great and the charging dock is super helpful for recharging an entire set + spares at the same time. Battery life is amazing compared to my previous system and I regularly get 6-7 hours runtime on a single battery and it comes with 12 for a 6pc set. Overall, a great investment that I have and will continue to use on every single shoot or professional production. 11/10 you won't be disappointed with this kit.

    Easy to use and works well. I purchased this during the Black Friday sale so it was a great price. Battery life seems better than advertised which is rare. With the extra set of batteries there is no downtime. The sound is very clear and you don't need to shout to be heard. The new model has noise cancelling as well so it would be even better but it does cost more. Overall I am very happy with this set.

    ITALe abbiamo testate su un set impegnativo. A differenza di altri brand risultano estremamente leggere e comode. Potendo inoltre scegliere la tipologia di padiglioni in condizioni di temperature elevate risultavano comunque confortevoli con il padiglione di spugna sostituito a quello chiuso in eco pelle. Gran parte del set prevedeva riprese su motoscafi in movimento e il segnale è rimasto ottimo nonostante le distanze di utilizzo. Inoltre la qualità del suono ci ha permesso di comunicare senza sforzo nonostante il vento e i forti rumori di sottofondo. Altro aspetto che abbiamo apprezzato è l'assoluta semplicità di utilizzo, fanno letteralmente tutto in automatico. La tecnologia DECT 6.0 oltre a criptare il segnale garantisce una stabilità del segnale impeccabile.La durata delle batterie è ottima, avendo a disposizione due batterie per ogni cuffia non è mai stato necessario utilizzare la dock di ricarica durante le lunghe giornate di riprese. Hanno un costo considerevole ma è assolutamente giustificato dalla qualità e sopratutto dall'affidabilità.Assolutamente consigliate!ENGWe tested them on a challenging set. Unlike other brands they turn out to be extremely light and comfortable. Also, being able to choose the type of on-ear cushions in hot conditions they were still comfortable with the foam substituted for the leather ones. Most of our set involved filming on moving boats, and the signal remained excellent despite the distances of use. In addition, the sound quality allowed us to communicate effortlessly despite the wind and loud background noise. Another aspect we appreciated is the absolute ease of use, they literally do everything automatically. DECT 6.0 technology not only encrypts the signal but also ensures impeccable signal stability.Battery life is excellent, with two batteries available for each headset, it was never necessary to use the charging dock during long days of filming. They have a considerable cost, but it is absolutely justified by the quality and, most importantly, the reliability.Absolutely recommended!

    ドローンの連絡用に購入。以前は補助者との連絡に特定小電力トランシーバーを使っていました。操縦者はほとんど手放し出来ないので、無線機の応答に苦労します。VOX機能付きや別売りマイクを使ったり。ギリギリを攻める撮影時には、補助者の助言が必要です。またプロポ画面に集中すると機体側の注意が薄れます。左右の障害物等を避ける為やロスト回避連絡に大変便利なインカム。一度使うと手放せないツールです。２台だけで通話の距離が延びれば嬉しいですが？（中継機無で）・・・現在は大満足です。

    Ho tentennato nell'acquisto del set, usato per piccole regie di eventi teatrali, ma invece ora sono molto soddisfatto. Le cuffie lavorano bene, senza sganci, con durata delle batterie sempre superiore agli eventi ""medi"" che riprendo.Certo, c'è molta plastica, e un minimo di cura nell'uso va posto, ma danno davvero una svolta a molti lavori multicamera.

No se si estoy contento o descontento con este producto.Me dedico al Sector Audiovisual y su función de comunicar a varias personas entre si con reducción de ruido y mute la cumple perfectamente, pero es cierto que la diadema es como muy grande en su forma más pequeña y notas que si vas a estar moviéndote da sensación de que no aprieta bien y se te va a caer.Es cierto que esta muy bien para conectar varias personas a la vez sin problemas, pero por ejemplo si solo quieres usarlo para dos personas, hay productos muchísimo más baratos y que funcionan perfectamente. El precio que tienen estos es un poco excesivo.La forma en la que vienen es cierto que es muy bonita y esta muy chula aunque es un maletín bastante grande para lo que es.

    Bought these after searching for reasonably priced Eartec system for production filming work.I have zero cons. Seriously, they worked perfectly straight out of the box. Range was excellent, clarity was amazing. I’d like the option to buy additional ‘slave’ units separately - maybe that is possible already?Basically - I want more! I bought the 3 as it was all I needed, but now that I know they perform so well I would get more to future proof production needs.My camera assistant even bought a set a week later as he was so impressed.

(Much longer than advertised) it was also a very hot day but I didn’t feel like the ear cup was causing me to feel discomfort!Would be interested in adding more headsets to my team as the team grows

    The Hollyland headsets are well made and work nice if you're in a quite environment.  If you try to use them in a loud setting i.e church, concert, wedding, sport setting they pick up all the surround noise and you cant hear the other person talking. It makes it very difficult to communicate. I wish i knew this before i purchased.  It got so bad for all the media team that i had to purchase all new ones from a different brand that work way better.

    We are going to use this as we stream HS Football & basketball games live. We use an Atem Mini Extreme for our video mixer. The problem was how to get the audio into the atem, which has 2 mike inputs. Work around, you get a xlr cable that plugs into a sm58 shure mike and then plug into 3.5mm split cable that plugs into the Atem. Then you put the mike next to one of the headsets and now you got 5 wireless headsets to use for the announcers and the field announcer and the 2 camera operators. Hollyland needs to make a breakout box for audio to plug direct into the Atem. It completely eliminates need for sound board, wireless mikes and wireless headsets. All with one headset.

    Overall, I like the product.  Just one star off because it was a bit tight when used.  Could possibly be due to the design. My other one, Lenovo,  was a lot more comfortable and enjoyable to use, the downside was the absence of nice bass.  Arctis 1 is quite good for communication and some music listening. Not outstanding at the musical side, I would say above average and pretty much acceptable for me. It has enough bass and punch to make the music alive.

    This was my first time getting stereo headphones for gaming. I preferred mono chat with my surround system.After going through 4 Xbox headsets in a year I wanted a better investment.I was skeptical that headphones could compare to my high end home audio system.My thoughts:I was pleasantly surprised on how much more I can hear footsteps playing first person shooters without the neighborhood hearing me playing War lolI chose these BC of the comfort and they had a mid range sound stage, not overly bass heavy.I find a bit of distortion if I have them loud and there is a ton of guns and explosions simultaneously.It's rare and I haven't been bothered by it yet.Bass is more than ample, I don't need bass driven directly into my ears.I found the highs weren't decent, wasn't tinny or too high, in fact I wanted a tiny bit more treble.When listening to music I was really surprised on how well they sounded, I tried a variety such as rap, metal, EDM and live accoustic. The accoustic guitar was really picked up well and the way tones  sounded really good.I will definitely be listening to music with these as well.The microphone is loud and clear, good background noise cancelling.**One note is check your headset volume on your Xbox settings BC it's default to 1/2 volume. I thought something was wrong at first, adjusted that and amazing!👍**

    I have a serious problem with wired headphones. For some reason, even wired headphones that I take very good care of end up with the wires getting pulled in just a way where one ear will stop working, or they only work when you twist them into a specific angle when plugged into your phone, etc... but these headphones are different. I wear my headphones almost 24/7 because I have autism and it helps soothe me, and I listen to loud music all the time as well as using them for gaming and using them for voice chats. These headphones can do it all. They are lightweight, affordable, AND I can wear them in bed while laying on my side for ages without feeling like my ear is going to fall off or explode. The removable microphone is very nice too as long as you don't lose it. I use these headphones every day and have been using them for over 3 years, only having to buy a single replacement pair whereas most headphones only last me like 4-5 months if I'm lucky, even ones at twice the price. The adjustable dial on the headphones themselves is perfect for quick adjustments, and the sound quality is very nice. I haven't noticed much sound leakage (sound escaping the headphones when turned up loud so other people can hear your stuff) compared to other headphones at the same price.If you're like me and you take even bare minimum care of your headphones, this pair will last you forever. I plan on just buying this set of headphones on repeat forever whenever I need a new pair- at least until they stop selling them, because I have NEVER found a pair that's as nice as these, especially on a budget. I would rate these headphones 100 stars If I could.

    Había comprado primero los JBL Quantum 100, excelentes pero las almohadillas de las orejas son sintéticas y sudaba mucho. Después unos HyperX, me apretaban la cabezota pero excelente sonido y micrófono, luego unos Corsair, pésimo micrófono pero cómodos y buen sonido, probé unos AstroGaming muy ligeros excelente sonido y micrófono pero las orejeras están muy reducidas. Al final después de ver algunos vídeos en internet compré los steel series. Excelentes por dónde lo vean, son los más caros de todos los que comenté pero valen cada centavo. Micrófono nítido, audio excelente, orejeras cómodas y no sudas. Lo recomiendo ampliamente.

    I record Youtube videos, and I've had headphones in the past where they bleed just enough audio that the microphone picks up some of the sound leaking out of the headphones (which is an editing nightmare).These ones don't bleed audio.Their sound quality is excellent, and it's easy to tell where enemies are coming from in Halo Infinite with their directional sound.  But most importantly, they are super comfortable. The fabric ear pads keep you from getting clammy or sweaty during long periods of wearing them.I also love the built in mute and volume control on the headset that don't require software integration, but is an actual hardware feature (nothing worse than a USB headphone that you ""asked"" to mute, but it never actually did it, so now your buddies get to hear you burp real loud in their ears).I will say that I don't love the microphone quality though. It's sufficient, but I have headsets with much better mics, so I almost always use this WITHOUT the microphone and instead use an external mic.So if you are buying this for the mic, I'd say it's only a 3 star review. If you are buying it for the headphones, then it's a solid 5!

    Upgraded from my Turtle Beach Stealth 700 to the Arctis 9x and was not impressed at all. Constant crackling sound despite various troubleshooting techniques I was looking up. I decided to give up on them and return them, which of course Amazon is amazing and their customer service was great! I ended up getting the Arctis 1 headset and so far I'm very happy. Sound quality is great, though I did have to use an older adapter I have to improve the volume, but all in all, these ones are absolutely phenomenal.

    Purchased this mainly for gaming on my PS5 and Xbox. Great audio sound for the price, and easy plug and play for both systems ( although for the Xbox there were a few sec delay before it actually switched to the headset). Love the ear cuffs as they are soft and very comfortable and covers the entirety of my ears. The band is also comfortable and doesn't squeeze your head/face but it does tend to be a little warm on the top of the head so I ended up having to wipe off sweat a few times. This was for longer sessions, like over an hour of use but if you don't have a/c or it's a warm day it may cause discomfort.Now for why it's not a 5 star - mic is horrible. It either doesn't work or when it does it is faint and tinny. I've even tried it out on my pc with all my audio software to see if I could find the issue, but nope the mic is just either bad or defective. I would return it but got a good deal on Warehouse and bought it mostly for the audio but keep that in mind. I've seen others report the same issues so it isn't uncommon.All in all, after a few months of use it's going strong and love the headset.

    I purchased these headphones in April 2022 and the mic on it stopped working suddenly in December 2022 and I literally searched all over the internet to get a replacement mic from anyone who deals for steelseries in india, found a company named techxhub, tried contacting them but no response, contacted steelseries support on steelseries official website and they told me that they do not ship to india otherwise they would have sent me a replacement mic for my headphones, hard luck i guess but then i contacted amazon and hats off to Amazon service they really care about their customers and they took the headphones back from me and told me that I'll get the full refund. But if I talk about the overall performance of these headphones I am pretty satisfied by the sound quality, the comfort and the overall experience was quite good actually but unfortunately steelseries not being prominent in india is a bummer.

    The sound quality is decent for the price and it's definitely comfortable to wear, but the microphone is just cheap. Taking into account other reviews, it seems that the microphone essentially comes down to luck. Sometimes it works perfectly, sometimes its just broken. Unfortunately it was the latter for me. If you need a decent mic, don't get this one, otherwise go crazy.

    Wie im Titel benannt, geht es hier um die Kabelvariante des SteelSeries Arctis 1:Ich habe dieses Headset auf Grund der guten Bewertungen mit BlackFriday Rabatt für 30€ (statt 59,99€) gekauft. Leider haben sich diese Bewertungen als typische Augenwischerei herausgestellt, weshalb ich nur davon abraten kann.Auf den beigefügten Bildern seht ihr ein abgenutztes Schrott-Headset von Tecknet aus dem Jahr 2017 für das ich damals 9,99€ bezahlt habe. (bekommt man bei Aliexpress inzwischen für 5€) und auf dem anderen Bild ist das neue Steelseries Arctis 1.Optik: ist Geschmackssache von daher keine BewertungTragekomfort: ist das Einzige wo das Arctis 1 im direkten Vergleich punkten kann. Ohrmuscheln lassen sich drehen und sind mit Synthetik-Stoff bezogen, welcher recht angenehm auf den Ohren sitzt; das obere Polster ist mit Kunstleder bezogen. Regelelemente (Lautstärke, Stumm) befinden sich direkt an der Ohrmuschel.Kabel: Das Tecknet hat ein solides, Nylon ummanteltes Kabel mit 2,2 Meter Länge und USB Anschluss - reicht also um auf der Couch oder am PC zu sitzen ohne das man eine Verlängerung braucht. Dazu kommt ein kleines Bedienfeld mit Lautstärkeregler, Beleuchtungsregler und Stummschalter.Das Arctis 1 hingegen hat ein dünnes Kabel mit Gummimantel , welches so dermaßen kurz ist, dass es ohne Verlängerung nicht mal dann reicht, wenn der PC genau neben dir steht. (1,2 Meter).Noch schlimmer ist aber, dass es im Artikel heißt:"" ""Kompatibel mit allen Plattformen"" was ein Witz ist, weil kein Signalsplitter für den 3,5mm Klinkenanschluss dabei ist. Den musst du extra kaufen damit du Mikro+Ton Anschluss am PC nutzen kannst. Heißt im Klartext also auf den Preis kommen nochmal 15€ für Verlängerung und Splitter drauf.Tonqualität: Hier habe ich absolut kein Verständnis für das Preis/Leistungsverhältnis und kann beim besten Willen die positiven Bewertungen nicht nachvollziehen. Fakt ist, dass das Headset regulär 59,99€ kostet. Beide Headsets haben exakt identische Spezifikationen und hören sich auch identisch (damit meine ich gleich schlecht) an. Ich erwarte ja keine Sennheiser oder Beyerdynamic MMX300 Studio Qualität, aber zumindest hätte ich vom Arctis mehr erwartet.Wer hier mehr als 3 Sterne vergeben hat ist offenbar stark schwerhörig und nicht in der Lage einen Unterschied zwischen Presslufthammer auf der Baustelle und einem Streichorchester zu finden.Mikrofon: Ich habe zu beiden Headsets mehrere Leute seperat befragt und 7 von 10 Leuten bewerten die Sprachqualität als identisch. 2 finden das Arctis besser, 1 Person das Tecknet.Fazit: Der fast 6 Jahre alte und stark abgenutzte Billigschrott von Tecknet für 9,99€ schlägt das 59,99€ teure Arctis 1 im Gesamtergebnis durch Preis und Ausstattung. Einfach nur erbärmlich.

    When I got it the mic worked fine for about an hour, but it stopped working completely. I tried unplugging it and plugging it back in and I tried turning the mic on and off. I thought it might have been my controller, but my other mic worked fine. I don't recommend buying this for the mic, buy sound quality is pretty good and it's comfortable.

    Lets talk about pros and consPros:really good microphone, 8/10Decent sound with DTX support could have been so much better 6.5/10Cons:Really cheap packagingReally bad connection with the mic and the mic doesn’t configured itself when plug in, major problems just trying to connect the microphone,Really fast getting heavy on your head for no reason despite being light, top of your head gonna feel annoying and uncomfortable after about 2 hours of wearing.Wiggling earpad it is annoying when you try to put it on with one handThe headphone is smaller than anyone headphones that I’ve used even.Overall 3/5 could find so much better gaming headphones from different brand, because steelseries is popular so the price is not fair compare to the actual product

    There's nothing very fancy about it, but you can tell the build quality when you pick it up. It doesn't feel plasticky of flimsy. It's solid and durable and that's the #1 feature I needed in a headset besides good audio/mic. In every other brand, I've had something either quit working or part of it break. I've had a couple of these for about a year and a half now and they're the only thing that's made it this long with 0 issues.

    This is a good headset - but good is where it ends. It is comfortable and pretty lightweight but that’s about it for the pros.The downsides I found after 3 months of use, there is not enough clamping force - I know this is difficult to get get right as too much clamping force can make the headset uncomfortable to wear but in this case there is not enough, this means that you can’t really hear the bass or your surroundings as good as other headsets. But it’s brilliant if you squeeze the ear-cups to your head so they really let this one down with this simple mistake.The second is, you can’t really hear anything at all unless you’re using some sort of amplifier. I have been using this headset in conjunction with the turtle beach audio attachment as just plugging the headset directly into the controller means you really can’t hear anything. Maybe that’s bias as I’ve used the Audio controller for around the last 6 years but I struggle to not use it with this steel series Arctis 1.Lastly, after 3 months I’ve noticed a static sound coming through the headset as it appears the 3.5mm jack has some sort of wiring fault or loose connection which almost makes games unplayable due to the stats if sounds coming through the speakers. It has inky just started with this fault.Also I find the mic is just not as flexible as I have been used to and really struggle to set it out if my peripheral vision when gaming or streaming a movie. It’s really short and stiff. Just not a good design.In conclusion just buy a turtle beach, I’ve never had any issues with them in the past, I opted to try a different brand after being with turtle beach for the past 10+ years and I’ve made a mistake. It’s hard to beat the best in the business.

    *This review is for the WIRED version of the headset. I almost didn't purchase these based off of negative reviews saying how the connectivity had issues, but then I realized these reviews seem to be both for the wired and wireless versions.______________________________________Summary:  This is a very comfortable, high quality headset with hit all of the bases with someone not looking to spend $100+ on a headset that may or may not feel like a bang for your buck.--------------------------------------Alright so for starters I was looking for some headphones that were an upgrade from my previous Turtle Beach Recon 50P (a great budget headset for anyone in a pinch), and I use my headphones for light gaming, music, and watching movies on my laptop when I go out and about.  I've had these for only a handful of days, but will provide an more updated, long-term review down the road when I think of it.I can't stress how dang comfortable the padding is...it's a cushion that easily fits over your whole ear and does not make you sweat like headsets with the leather-like material that many have.  The sound is not distorted and hits the bass very well, and they fit very, very well.Behind the left ear there's a little knob that lets you adjust the sound easily, and there's also a convenient switch for the microphone in the same area. I can't speak for the microphone quality yet, but I can tell you that It is detachable and I will update my review when I do end up using it.On the box it literally has a statement saying something on the lines of, ""This feels way more expensive then what it is!"", I'm inclined to full-heartedly agree with that.  Hope this review helps anyone that's on the fence!

    I wear a turban so I wanted a large headset to go over it.I've been using an MPOW H17 for a few years, and am sensitive to headset weight.This part had way too much clamping force while also feeling heavy, and providing a bad seal.At the same time, it is only $25 CAD + tax for a warehouse model.I will try the Arctis 3 in the future as that has the ski goggle headband which provides a superior fit despite the fragility.

    The ear cups are much larger than I expected which is great. I wear glasses, but the cushion is soft enough to be acceptable. Clamping a little bit hard though, although I do have pretty big head among normal population - The upside is that sound isolation is awesome! Totally shielding me from outside sound which makes my wife a bit mad :) One minor thing to note is that the headband doesn't extend very long, <2cm on each side.

    So in order to make this microphone work on PC(more likely a laptop with TRRS like in my case), you need to go to your Realtek audio panel under Device Advanced settings switch the Connector Retasking ANALOG to Headset...Sounds good mic works fine, cable should be about 3 feet longer imo or at the very least make the part that connects interchangable(modular)

    You need to purchase an usb port seperately. Not sure why it’s not supported regardless of which console it’s for or PC, but all 3 have usb ports so why would the headphones not include the port option that works with each device? This isn’t the sellers fault at all it’s more so the manufacturers fault for lack of detail. Regardless, I would order again because of the price to quality that you’re getting (they sound great) but I’d purchase a usb adapter right away or spend a little more and get a headset with an included usb plug in.

    So, after a few weeks with this. The worst part about this is the cord length. If I ever lose access to my front IO then this headset might as well go straight to the trash. Bad enough I yank out the cord the second I have to move while playing a game. I can't even lean back in my chair due to the shortness of the cable. Whoever thought less than 6 feet was the right length for headphone cable should be fired!

    Llego a tiempo y en buen estado. El peso de los audifonos es ligero, la posición de las almohadillas de los auriculares es ergonomicas y genera que no sea cansado el uso prolongado, así mismo, trae control de volumen en el auricular izquierdo. El cable del audifono es un poco corto a mi parecer.

    Brought around March 2021, first year everything was pretty decent, just as good as expensive Razor headset's with the mic and audio quility being good. Started to notice the mic and audio quility started getting worse after a years use and now friends can barely hear me and audio is starting to get worse over time. If you're looking for a pair of budget headset's to last you till you can get a better one and need good quility in both mic and audio then this will do you perfectly fine, but be warned, the headset is definitely not a long lasting pair. Most headsets I've got in the £50-150 price range normally last me around 3-5 years, these only lasted about a year, but for the price, it's a grab if you're low on money but are desperate to get a quility headset in the meantime. And as prices are still going up on everything, then get these while you still can as even technology and equipment for gaming is starting to go up in the last year (not just living, bills etc). So grab a pair while you can or if you can wait then I recommend getting some Astros or Razor headsets. Probably contradict myself here, but the durability is excellent, just the actual audio and mic quility over a short period goes down extremely fast once you start to notice it. Anyway, overall, decent pair of budget headset's here.

    So it's a little above avg. Sounds good but  you do have to have the volume a little on the high side to cancel all ambient noise. The mic is its true downfall. I had to talk louder than usual for it.But it does sound good and it is durable compared to some others.

    For the price, it's absolutely amazing - perfect sound (on both ends), flip to turn on mic, etc. The only two flaws were that it's a little uncomfortable on your head after around 2 hours, and the ear muffs aren't very soft. Aside from that, I would definitely think of this first if my budget is tight.

    I had a pair of turtle beach headphones that snapped and broke over time (maybe because of my huge head!). They have definitely improved and this pair have lasted me a fair while. Sound quality and mic are surprisingly good for the price. I liked the look and the discrete microphone which when turned up is muted. I liked them so much I bought a pair for my son to use on his Nintendo switch. They are comfortable and a great upgrade from my non-brand headphones.

    Terribly disappointed with the quality of the mic. The mic doesn't properly pick up your voice because it's so short and can't be oriented. The result is that you sound like you're in another room, and people will have a hard time hearing you.Might work with kids (smaller head, so mic *might* be better able to pick up voice), but I wouldn't bother trying. Go for a headset with a flexible mic that you actually can talk into.On the plus side, the sound quality is good!

    The plastic used for the headset does not inspire anhigh degree of quality or durability, but don't r the headset price is acceptable.The microfon cable does not have a textile exterior housing and therefore I am afraid it will not last too long.A headset storage case/bag it would have been welcomed, unfortunately it is not part of the package.

    日本のレビューは全く無かったのですが海外からのレビューを見ると非常に好評だったので購入。マイクの音質はまあ聞けるレベルで音質も同価格帯のステレオヘッドセットと比べても良い方だと思います。本体重量に関しては225gとかなりの軽量。側圧もきつくはないので長時間の使用に向いているかと思います。ただ付属のUSBDACや分極ケーブルの類はないのでPCでマイクを使いたいという人には最初の一台にはおすすめしません。

    Pur non essendo una marca famosa si è fatta valere per la qualità dei suoi prodottiOrmai sono un videogiocatore da parecchi anni, e per questo ho potuto testare molti tipi di periferiche e con queste, vari tipi di cuffie, e devo dire che con queste mi sono trovato particolarmente bene.Ma partiamo dall'arrivo:Le cuffie mi sono arrivate con un anticipo di 1 o 2 giorni non ricordo, erano imballate e protette perfettamente da eventuali urti o graffi. La confezione e semplice e non ha particolari pezzi dispersi nella scatola.La cuffia è composta da: un mixer del volume dietro il padiglione sinistro, il microfono che può essere utilizzato in 3 modi:1) Aperto, quindi parlando2) A metà, quando ci si vuole mutare3) E infine spostato indietro, che consiglio quando non si usa proprio parlare magari nei giochi offlineDa gamer, ho acquistato davvero parecchie paia di cuffie, che siano per ascoltare la musica, lavorare o giocare. Ho trovato di meglio con Razer, ma spendendo molto di più, infatti un vantaggio enorme di queste cuffie è il rapporto qualità prezzo. Mi sono trovato davvero benissimo e le sto utilizzando tutt'ora da 2 anni che le ho comprate, difficilmente si trova di meglio a questo prezzo.La qualità del suono è davvero pazzesco e il microfono si sente benissimo estraniando le voci o i rumori nei dintorni. Per non parlare della perfezione e della comodità del padiglione, pur facendo lunghe sessioni di gioco non ho mai avuto dolori alle orecchie, cosa che invece capitava con altre paia di cuffie.Sono delle cuffie surround quindi in giochi in cui è necessario sentire l'ambiente esterno come magariTom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege sono perfette. Infatti grazie a queste sono riuscito ad avere una migliore performance in giochi come questi.L'unico difetto che mi sento di dare è che dopo un po di tempo il microfono quando viene spostato fa parecchi rumori come se fosse un cigolio della porta, e non è una cosa da poco anche perché mi ritrovo molto spesso a spostare il microfono per mutarmi e sento questo fastidioso rumore.Mentre invece premio molto la resistenza del cavo che a distanza di più di 2 anni mi tiene ancora compagnia come quando è arrivato e il jack non si è rovinato di una virgola.Potete vedere le condizioni della cuffie nelle immagini che ho messo, ovviamente dovete contare che sono state acquistate 2 anni fa e nonostante ciò sono ancora in perfette condizioni.Concludo dicendo che mi sono trovato molto bene e le consiglio soprattutto alle persone che fanno lunghe sessioni di gioco perché in testa non si sentono proprio e per ora rimangono le mie cuffie preferite rapporto qualità\prezzo.

    I ordered this product already being familiar with the brand of TurtleBeach. I've been a customer for close to 6 years and have gone through 3 Recons over that time period that have all served me greatly in sound, durability and mic quality. So my expectations were high when i saw a new model. However while the product meets my expectations in terms of sounds and durability (so far), the mic quality is reportedly worse than its predecessor. The wide census from friends and strangers was ""are you using earphones or something your mic is ****"". This has quite obviously irritated me and has left me disappointed hence the 3 star review. In summary don't let the ""unique features"" off a flippable mic sway you into purchasing this headset. I'd recommend sticking to the older models manufactured by turtle beach or other competitors.

    Bought these as a nurse needing new work shoes. One thing I will say is these are not suitable for nurses. They are waterproof, so good for showering. However, they are not non-slip. It feels like I’m standing on concrete for long periods of time.  Otherwise they’re a good shoe, just not for nurses.

    I ordered the color black, womens size 9, which is my typical size. Not only are these shoes gorgeous, but they are SO incredibly comfortable! Honestly, they are one of the most comfortable pairs of shoes I have ever worn. I wore them for the first time this past Saturday (the day they were delivered), and they were not tight, as new shoes typically are. I actually forgot I had them on when I came back home. As someone who prefers to be barefooted, these shoes are amazing! I just placed my order for the white pair, and I hope they fit exactly the same!

    Got size 11US and no where close, have used other brands same size with out issue, these were at least 13. Next issue is the return, apparent failed attempts when I was definitely at home, when finally picked up they said it wasn’t so probably out 120.00. Lesson learned is unless you actually know they will fit and won’t need to be returned then stay away or resell them on eBay or something

    I thought this was a great deal when I bought it because of the price and the brand. However, the sneakers are not comfortable at all. They are so heavy that I can only wear them when I know I will be sitting down. If I walk or stand in them for any length of time, my feet start to hurt. I definitely will not be buying these sneakers again. Lacoste sneakers are much more comfortable.

    i wore these twice and had to take them off after 10 minutes the first time. Wore them a second time and they literally wore the skin off the back of my heals. They are the correct size but horribly made. Bought another pair elsewhere (same brand) and the stitching on the sole at the back of one of the shoes broken after wearing half a dozen times or so. Do NOT buy this brand of shoe. Quality is extremely low and price is high, even for a good shoe.. which these are most certainly NOT!

Das Leder, aus dem diese Sneaker gefertigt sind, ist von ausgezeichneter Qualität und fühlt sich langlebig an. Es ist nicht nur strapazierfähig, sondern verleiht den Sneakern auch einen Hauch von Eleganz, der sie von anderen abhebt.Der Tragekomfort ist ein weiteres bemerkenswertes Merkmal dieser Sneaker. Die Sohle ist gut gepolstert und bietet den ganzen Tag über hervorragende Unterstützung für meine Füße. Egal, ob ich einen langen Spaziergang mache oder den ganzen Tag auf den Beinen bin, diese Sneaker bieten den nötigen Komfort.Der minimalistische Stil dieser Sneaker ist ein weiterer Pluspunkt. Sie sind vielseitig genug, um zu verschiedenen Outfits zu passen, sei es Jeans und ein T-Shirt oder Chinos und ein Hemd. Das ikonische Tommy Hilfiger-Logo an der Seite verleiht ihnen eine subtile, aber erkennbare Markenpräsenz.Die Passform war für mich perfekt, und ich schätze die hochwertigen Schnürsenkel, die fest sitzen und nicht ständig nachgezogen werden müssen.Obwohl diese Sneaker etwas teurer sind, sind sie meiner Meinung nach jeden Cent wert. Sie vereinen Qualität, Stil und Komfort in einem, und ich erwarte, dass sie mich noch lange begleiten werden. Wenn Sie auf der Suche nach hochwertigen Sneakern mit zeitlosem Design sind, kann ich die Sneaker wärmstens empfehlen.

    白一色や黒一色のスニーカーに飽きて、何かいい色のスニーカーはないかな？とずっと探していて、この色を発見！モノトーンの服でもさし色で合わせやすく、またブルージーンズに合わせても今までにない配色で新鮮でとても気に入りました。カジュアルでない服装にも使えそうです。また底の薄いスニーカーだと足が疲れたり踵が痛くなるのですが、これは厚底でクッションもしっかりしており、それでいて重たくなく、お気に入りの一足になりました！しかも本体は一部フェイクレザーもありますが本革で、コストパフォーマンスもかなり良いです！

    Los tenis son bonitos, pero su calidad deja mucho que desear. En cuanto me llegaron pude notar que ya estaban despegados de una pequeña zona. Probablemente no muy visible a simple vista, pero eso si así están sin una sola puesta, imagínense cuando los empiece a usar. Al final los tuve que devolver.Definitivamente no me quedaron ganas de volver a comprar tenis de esta marca, nada que ver con la calidad que ofrecen otras marcas que también rondan por el mismo precio, como Nike o Adidas.

    Fake, non genuine! They arrived with stitching loose and coming undone. Stitching is very inconsistent on both shoes and so is the bottom of both shoes. Inner sole not stuck down and comes out. Don't buy. Very disappointing! They should have said they were fake.

    Initially they look nice and suit comfortable. After nearly 2 months of ocassional use (normal use for walking) they show worn soles as seen in images, so really unsure how long they will be in usable condition. I find them of poor quality for the price they cost and the brand prestige (assuming they are not fake).

After wearing these Guess shoes, I feel compelled to share my experience with other potential buyers. The first thing that strikes you is the quality of craftsmanship: the premium leather blends beautifully with a small patent detail on the back, creating a texture play that catches the eye. The gold Guess lettering on the side adds a touch of class without being overbearing, well balanced in the overall design of the shoe.But the real surprise is in the details: the last lace hole features a refined golden circle, set with subtly sparkling little diamonds. This detail elevates the shoes, making them suitable not only for everyday wear but also for those events where a touch of elegance is a plus.In terms of comfort, these shoes are a dream come true. The sense of comfort is immediate as soon as you slip them on: the support is optimal, the fit perfect, as if they were tailor-made for my foot. It's rare to find shoes that so effectively combine aesthetics with comfort, but Guess has hit the mark.In summary, these Guess shoes are a true gem in the wardrobe. Suitable for everyday use, but with that extra touch that makes them special. Whether it's a day at the office, a drink with friends, or a stroll around the city, these shoes never disappoint. They are proof that you can be comfortable without sacrificing elegance.

    I am very happy with these shoes, I bought them to wear in the office and they look nice enough to pass for business casual. They were a bit stiff at first but they broke in quickly. Fit true to size. I don’t wear them for a lot of walking but they’re comfortable around the office.

Ho recentemente acquistato le scarpe da ginnastica GUESS GWLOVEN per mia moglie, che calza il numero 38, e la mia scelta si è rivelata assolutamente azzeccata per due ragioni fondamentali. In primo luogo, mia moglie è da sempre una fan del marchio Guess, considerato una garanzia di qualità per noi. In secondo luogo, il prezzo estremamente interessante ha reso l'acquisto ancora più allettante.Dalle foto online, le scarpe sembravano già molto belle, ma devo dire che dal vivo sono ancora più sorprendenti. La consegna è stata impeccabile, con le scarpe presentate in una scatola bianca elegante dai bordi dorati, richiamando il tono dorato delle stesse scarpe.La calzata è perfetta e la scarpa è incredibilmente comoda grazie alla sua morbidezza. Le cuciture presenti conferiscono un effetto elegante che aggiunge prestigio al design complessivo. Alcuni dettagli che particolarmente abbiamo apprezzato includono due parafori con piccoli diamanti all'estremità delle scarpe, un tocco chic ed elegante. Le strisce dorate sul tacco sono imponenti e aggiungono un tocco di colore accattivante alle scarpe bianche. Infine, il marchio Guess è non solo stampato, ma addirittura in rilievo dorato, un dettaglio di classe.Queste scarpe GWLOVEN sono un mix perfetto tra eleganza e sportività. Sebbene siano concepite come scarpe da ginnastica, il loro design raffinato le rende adatte anche a occasioni più formali. La cura dei dettagli, la qualità costruttiva e il comfort che offrono le rendono un acquisto eccezionale. In conclusione, sono estremamente soddisfatto di questo acquisto e consiglio vivamente le GUESS GWLOVEN a chi cerca un paio di scarpe che uniscano stile, eleganza e comfort in un unico prodotto.

    Obviously a decent product, but the quality is not what I expected from Crocs. It is somewhat flimsy which makes it difficult to fit into. Once they are on, they are comfy but I would not recommend this for anyone, like me, that has difficulty bending down to pull the shoe over the heel, which by the way is not easy either. My previous garden shoes were Sloggers and they are more sturdy and better in design and no assist needed to fit your feet. I only bought the Crocks because the Sloggers were out of stock at that time and figured they would be of same quality. I regret that decision now and am about to order new Sloggers.

    First time in 48 years of chefing that I have worn clogs. Makes me wonder why I took so long. I wasn't expecting them to be so easy to wear. To the point where I usually can't wait to get my work boots off and get into more comfortable shoes. Last night I walk out and went home with the clogs still on. There was no urge to take them off.

    I do a lot of remodeling and construction on my house inside and out and have to be on my feet for 8 or 10 hours at a time. I have been having more problems with that lately apparently due to insufficient width on shoes. I haven't been able to find a good shoe for this until I got a bit desperate and decided to try these ""on the clock"" crocs. I have two pairs of the regular ones I used for lounging at home and at my office when it's snowy and I don't want to track in. So I understood that they are comfortable, but didn't think of them as great for climbing ladders and working on scaffolding. In fact, I tried on those and it was scary. This shoe is very different. Stays on your foot securely but still very comfortable. I worked about six hours today for the first test and had no foot fatigue at all. Size 11 is my sneaker size and that fit great. I was concerned it would slip too much on my heal but no problem. Felt safe on ladders and even went to Menards wearing them. And they aren't as dorky looking as one might think -- though they do remind me of my dad's old galoshes. Others have commented on the hot and sweaty factor. In the 50s today and 65 indoors. Didn't notice this as an issue but as summer comes I may rethink that. Not quite sure why they aren't better vented. I will say one thing about using them in construction...no steel toe! So if you are working heavy machines or at risk of a smash, this is not a great idea. Otherwise, I think they may solve my problems.

    I have worn these shoes to do my gardening every day for the past week.  They are so comfortable.  I go sockless and so far they don't smell.  They have great traction.  When the grass was wet or the garden was muddy, I didn't slip at all. They keep the water and mud out even when I've sprayed them with the hose.  I can wear them for hours and my feet still don't hurt.  I wear a size 8 1/2.  I bought size 9.  They fit perfectly. The icing on the cake is just how fun and cheerful they are to look at.  They are adorable!  How did I garden all these years without them?!?!

    I ordered these with, I must admit, low expectations. After all, they were inexpensive and waterproof and I just wanted them for the garden.  When they arrived I was so pleasantly surprised and pleased by the quality of these shoes, and how easy they are to use. I can easily slip them on and off to hop on out to the garden and back yard when ever I want - and they look amazing. They are so comfortable I can wear them all day long, with a nice sole, there is plenty of bounce under the step. They run true to size, so don't order 'up a size' like you might be tempted to do for a shoe like this, you won't have to. I'd wear these anywhere.

    I bought these for several applications, wet grass, cleaning the yard, grooming dogs, house shoe, lawn mowing.  I bought them in several different colors to go with different outfits.  I really like them, they are convenient.  I normally wear an 8 1/2 in regular shoes so I got a size 9.  I bought these to save my regular shoes from wear during different situations when it is wet, or dirty work needs to be performed.

    As an avid gardener, I’ve worked outdoors in Sloggers over the years ever since I bought my muted red ones back when I discovered them the first time. They wear really well and I occasionally put on anklets so my feet don’t get too sweaty. They never really wear out, but when I see a design I love like this one, I had to have them!

    These are very cute. I love them in the garden they just rinse right off. My neighbor uses hers to pick up her dog doody lol but she loves them. I had ordered a size 9 as I usually wear an 8.5 wide. They do not come in 1/2 sizes. When I received them they were marked as a size 10 & too large so I had return them unfortunately. I was able to find another pair in town but very happy! I want to order the tall rain boots now too 👍 they are water proof & rinse off easily.

    Had a pair years from QVC and decided to buy a new pair from Amazon. My shoe size is a 8 1/2 so of course I order the 9’s , the fit was spot on . I paid more money on the Q and they’re  prices went up also. Buying them on Amazon was a no brainer. I get up early in the mornings to feed the birds and water my garden and my tennis shoes always got wet from the morning dew on the lawn.

These are great for gardening or whenever you would be dealing with water or mud. I ordered an 8.5 my normal size and they are a little small so if ordering I would order a size and a half up.  The Sloggers are water proof, very easy to clean and have a nice grip. I would definitely buy them again, oh and good quality.

    I buy these for two reasons. One, I run an LLC that offers work inside the home. I use one pair solely for wearing in clients’ homes so my shoes are always clean. Two, I am often in the yard or the garden. These are awesome for wearing and hosing off. They are comfortable and keep my feet from wearing out before the rest of me does, still, they could use a tad more arch support. If you are worried about getting mud or water in your shoe, they have a boot that is great too.

En este caso un 10 por Amazon.Bueno, referente a las zapatillas poco que comentar. Excelente superior. Se adaptan al pié de manera sorprendente, con un ajuste,en mi caso casi perfecto. Es una sensación de tener tacos en el pié directamente. No hubiera imaginado que pudiera haber un calzado así. Y sí,lo hay. Por lo que a mí respecta,ha sido una gran adquisición. Espero disfrutarlas mucho tiempo! Corrigiendo el tallaje no dudo en recomendarlas.

    A little snug when I first tried them on, but after walking around a while I realize they fit just fine. I have used these for just golf, best golf shoes I have ever had. I was concerned about scuffing the greens with the aggressive tread on the bottom but this has not been an issue. I walk 18 holes (pushing a cart) 3 or 4 days a week and after 6 rounds there is no evidence of wear on the bottom. I do try to keep off the cart path and walk on grass as much as I can. Comfortable, durable, good looking, and the easy pull up ""laces"" all equal a great product. These are waterproof and I just bought a second pair (of the non-waterproof version) for summertime use.

    Wer mit dem Hund, der gerne an der Leine zieht, auf nassen, matschigen Wald- und Feldwegen unterwegs ist, bergauf und schlimmer bergab, der hat hier den richtigen Schuh. Ich laufe nicht mehr wie auf Eis, sondern sicher wie auf einem erstklassigen Parkweg. Kein Wegrutschen, die Knie bleiben heil, der Hintern macht keine Bekanntschaft mehr mit dem Matschboden. So entspannend. Auch auf dem asphaltiertem Straßenstück bis zum Wald laufe ich sicher. Eine nasse abschüssige Wiese überqueren - kein Thema mehr.Und der Schuh ist leicht. Kein Vergleich mit meinen schweren Wanderschuhen.Ich habe die Schuhe jetzt gut einen Monat im Einsatz. Über die Haltbarkeit kann ich noch nichts sagen.

    I’ve used the trail running shoe on three occasions since I purchased them just over a week ago. The footpaths that I have run are fairly level (in terms of ascent and descent) but are normally wet, slippery and rutted at this time of year. First impressions are that these trail shoes provide a sturdy and surefooted feel. The trainer soles dig into the surface and provide a strong degree of certainty. Having used road shoes in the past, it takes a couple of miles to appreciate the confidence they provide.The shoes are lightweight, comfortable and easy to put on / take off.I normally take an 11 in shoe. I ordered an 11.5 in the trail shoe which is just about right.

    I've had my pair of Salomon Speed Cross 5 GTX since Apr. 2023 and they still surprise me each time I slip them on. If my feet could talk they would probably describe these shoes as comfy house slippers with cleats. I appreciate the next level of engineering that went into these shoes. From the stealthy gortex shell to the quick-release wire lases. Water and debris won't get in and so easy to put on for a quick step outside without tying any lases. BRAVO. I have very high arches making it so so difficult to find shoes that don't hurt my feet. My feet require a wide toe box and extra cushion under the ball of the foot. To make these shoes perfect for me, I paired them with the AIRR Softsole Perform inserts.

    Ich laufe Schuhe verschiedener Marken, primär Hoka, Salomon und Brooks. Bisher war Hoka für mich die Nummer 1, super verarbeitet, hoher Tragekomfort, relativ lange Haltbarkeit (hängt natürlich davon ab, wie viele Kilometer man die Woche damit abreißt). Diese Laufschuhe setzen noch einen drauf, super Grip im Gelände, gerade auf weichem Untergrund (Sand, Matsch, Schnee), hoher Tragekomfort, und zum Schnellschnürsystem (Quicklace System) von Salomon muss ich nichts sagen, das fetzt einfach. Von außen kann in den Schuh auch nichts reinkommen, was beim Laufen stört (kleine Steinchen), und Regen sollte den Schuhen auch nichts anhaben. Wasserdicht sind sie sicher nicht, aber bis die innen naß sind, muss es schon ordentlich schütten. Alles in allem ein super durchdachter Laufschuh für's Gelände, echt Mega!

    軽くて使いやすいGORE-TEX採用のトレッキングにも使用できるシューズを探していて、ちょうどセールになっていたこともあり、Try before you buyを利用してフィッティングをした後購入しました。まずは以下フィッティングをした感想です。※普段のスニーカーは26.5cm～27.0cmで足は細身。NIKE FITでもAF1やDUNKで27.0cmがベストサイズの案内。27.0cm→薄手の靴下を履いた状態で問題なく履ける。まさにピッタリという感じで、足先などが不自然に当たったり詰まる感じも無し。但し、冬場に厚手の靴下を履くとややタイトになりすぎるかと感じた。27.5cm→薄手の靴下を履いた状態だと余裕を持って履け、ストラップで締めればきっちりと足にフィットさせる事ができる。厚手の靴下を履いた状態でピッタリといった感じ。28.0cm→薄手の靴下だとかなり余裕ができる。ストラップで締めれば問題なくフィットさせられるが、逆にここまで余裕をもたせる必要はな無いかと感じた。厚手の靴下を履いても余裕を持って履ける感じ。いずれも夜の、やや足が浮腫んだ時間帯にフィッティングをしたので、朝とかであれば上記より更に余裕が出ると感じました。ただ、自分の場合は足が細身であるので普段の靴と同サイズでも問題なく履けるという感想になったものの、日本人に多い幅広の足の方で、普段3E～4Eを履かれる方なら通常のスニーカー+1cmでも問題ないと思います。私の場合は以上の感想から冬場のことも考慮し27.5cmを選択。本格的に山で履く前に、足に馴染ませるため街中で1日履いた感想としては、舗装路でも十分にクッションが効き、またアッパー全体で足をホールドできるようになっている為ブレも少なく疲れが少ないと感じました。当然のことながらGORE-TEX採用でラグも深いので多少の雨やぬかるみなども問題なし。SALOMONのシューズ全般がそうですが、軽いのも大きなアドバンテージになっていると思います。最新の現行モデルとしてはSPEED CROSS 6が出ていますが、よほど本気のトレイルランをしない限りはこちらのSPEED CROSS 5でも十分な性能ですので、買って損は無い1足。

    Firstly, these come up small so you'll need to size up by 0.5-1 size.They look great and have been comfortable to wear so far.However, they're not very practical for anywhere other than trails. There is almost no grip on flat smooth surfaces. I find myself sliding all over the place on walks around the village. Pavements, bricks, tiles, paving, manhole covers all become an unexpected challenge to remain upright on.

La suola non si consuma facilmente,molto buona anche su asfalto. Il colore  che ho preso tende un po’ a macchiarsi in punta perché chiaro ma si puliscono facilmente e tornano nuove. Chiusura a cinghia a scomparsa. Si allacciano senza modo basta tirare e si indossano e tolgono in pochi secondi. Ottima scarpa. Ne ho presi 2 paia.

    I second all the complaints about the wrong size for these shoes.I supposedly ordered size 13, but they were more like size 11.They must be American sizes, not UK's.On the same day I ordered some ""Crocs Mens Santa Cruz Loafers"" also size 13, and these arrived on time and fitted perfectly.So there is a screw up somewhere in Amazon.And the fit was only ""Medium"", Not wide.Come on AMAZON. WHEN WILL YOU DISPLAY WIDTHS FOR SHOES??? PLEASE!!!Also, these came from America to the UK and took absolutely ages (4 weeks) to get here.They look nice and comfortable, so i will return for larger pair, if I can get them.(The Crocs Mens Santa Cruz Loafers are super comfortable!!)

    Well I bought 4 pairs as they are so well made and comfy.I tend to have poor ankle's that can give a bit of pain now and again due to having sprained both over the years, I also have a funny big toe that can play up, a bit like a bunion. So I have had no problems with either swelling due I think to the insert, also the air holes stop your feet getting hot.

    If these shoes were alive I'd marry them!  Wait...I'm married...nevermind.  I really, really like these shoes and I'm on my third pair.  I wear them until the soles wear too thin for traction a then they are trashed.  The arch support is fantastic and by the way, when you wear this shoe out, save the insoles!  Put them in shoes that need it!  I have seen these on sale (used) on EBay) and should you be tempted, buy the shoe for the insoles and throw the shoe away.  They don't wear out and they don't flatten.  If you have bad knees, back or hip joints and the like, then these are for you guys and girls, too!

But I suggest don't use this shoes in summer and climates of Chennai is not suitable for this shoe. I can feel the sweat inside the shoe and the heat is not being absorbed by the upper material..

    Scarpe originali e arrivate nei tempi previsti. Ho letto molte recensioni prima di decidere che numero prendere, alla fine ho scelto la mia solita misura e secondo me è quella giusta. Come scritto in un'altra recensione, la scarpa è larga in punta ma perfetta dietro, ed essendo molto rigide all'inizio temo che una misura in meno potrebbe creare dei problemi; in più non penso che la grandezza crei difficoltà nel camminare. Il modello è in pelle liscia non lucida come si vede in foto, classica pelle degli anfibi dr.martens

    Ich habe den Schuh vor ein paar Wochen gekauft und bin bisher sehr zufrieden. Eine schmerzhafte Zeit des Einlaufens habe ich nicht erlebt. Ich habe den Schuh angezogen und er hat gepasst. Er ist jetzt zu meinem Lieblingsschuh geworden. Meiner ist aus Thailand und ich habe weder beim verwendeten Material, noch bei der Verarbeitung Defizite oder Mängel erkannt. Lasst Euch von den negativen Beurteilungen nicht abschrecken. Klare Kaufempfehlung!Nachtrag 02.04.14: inzwischen habe ich dasselbe Modell, allerdings in England produziert, gekauft. Ich habe es kürzlich auf einer anderen Plattform für 180 Euro + ca. 10 Euro für den Versand aus England erstanden. Die Unterschiede die ich festgestellt habe sind durchaus erkennbar. 1. der Schuh aus Thailand ist bei gleicher Schuhgröße wesentlich weiter, er wirkt auch optisch breiter. 2. beim made in England Modell sind die Nähte gleichmässiger (jeder Stich gleich lang), 3. und für mich am Wichtigsten: die Qualität des Leders vom Schuh aus England ist besser. Es ist robuster und Schuhcreme zieht wesentlich schneller ein. Dennoch nehme ich meine Kaufempfehlung für dieses Angebot nicht zurück. Wenn man beachtet, dass je nach Angebot zwischen 100 und 120 Euro Differenz zwischen den Paaren liegen, relativieren sich diese Unterschiede ein Stück weit. Wer hier kauft macht nichts falsch, auch wenn ich das englische Paar ein klein wenig mehr mag.

    Son increíblemente bonitos. Estéticamente super versátiles y aportan un plus de modernidad a cualquier estilismo. Sin embargo, son realmente incómodos. Llevo poniéndonmelos día sí, día no, durante más de tres semanas y aún molestan un poco al final del día. Cuidado con la talla, yo, siguiendo las recomendaciones de otros compradores, me pedí una talla menos de la mía y los encuentro algo justos, sobre todo porque para domarlos sin que te hagan ampollas hay que usar doble calcetín o calcetín de lana gordo...

    What a great pair of shoes. I love 'em! Firstly, I read all the reviews and knew that these were not made in the UK, nor have they been since 2003, and can say that they are well made in Thailand...very well made actually. They are a quite substantial pair of shoes that are going to take a bit of time to break in as the leather is quite thick and stiff. With the proper care, these babies should last a long time. There was a hiccup with the delivery on my end, a local courier which was not amazon's fault, that delayed delivery. These shoes fit well, sizing is accurate, are comfortable and will get more so with wear and absolutely look the part. Secondly, I liked them so much, a week later I got a pair of DMC 8053 gaucho crazy horse. ""Buy a pair, you can't go wrong"".

    Bought for my daughter as school shoes, following the demise of her no-longer-red-but-dead shoes. I think these are possibly a slight degree above the expected size, but that is perfect for her feet.The shoes arrived next day with Prime and are the genuine article, which means the usual Dr Marten quality. Not only that, but they were as much as thirty quid cheaper than other places I looked online, never mind the high street shoe shops, who were even dearer still!Eleanor has worn them for a week now and she says they are the epitome of comfort, and the envy of many of her friends. You just know that they will last, too, because of the legendary durability of Docs. Let's hope her feet don't grow anymore for a while!

    Die Rezension gilt dem Modell 1461Z schwarz, mit gelber Naht, Herstellung in Vietnam.Auf der Suche nach neuem Schuhwerk stieß ich auf diesen Kultschuh meiner Jugend...Zuerst hatte ich Zweifel ein altbewährtes Produkt zu bestellen, bei welchem der Hersteller seine Produktion nach Asien verlegt hat. Arge Skepsis hatte ich hinsichtlich der verwendeten Materialien, da ich auf Weichmacher stark reagiere.Doch: der Schuh ist gut verarbeitet, dass heisst die Nähte sind sauber und gleichmässig. Der Tragekomfort ist spitze. Zwei Tage ein wenig 'Docs AuaAua' die harten Lederränder betreffend aber längst nicht so, wie ich es von früher in Erinnerung habe! Und wer will kann dem ja mit altbekannten Tricks entgegenwirken.Das Obermaterial besteht aus Leder und der Innenschuh aus Leder und Textil. Dementsprechend passt sich der Schuh sehr schnell dem Fuss an und nach drei Tagen saß er bei mir wie angegossen. Super gemütlich! Die Größe entspricht meiner reellen Schuhgröße 42 (UK 8). Ein Top Produkt zu einem Top Preis!Die Lieferung war schnell und die Verpackung dem Produkt angepasst, also nicht mehr Karton als sein muss.Ob das Produkt unter fairen Bedingungen hergestellt wurde kann ich leider nicht beurteilen.Ansonsten ganz klare Kaufempfehlung für 5 Sterne! Ergänzung 2023...sie begleiten mich immer noch.

Al tatto risultano molto rigide e ""grandi"" e ho temuto per aver sbagliato numero, cosa di cui ero dubbioso fin dall'inizio. Inaspettatamente le scarpe hanno calzato subito bene. Solitamente porto un numero 44 di Vans (che sono le sole che utilizzo) e di queste ho ordinato un 43. La parte centrale calza precisamente e lascia un pò di spazio in prossimità della punta, piuttosto spessa. Ora sono in fase di ""collaudo"": le sto portando poche ore al giorno da qualche giorno, per abituare il piede e adattare la forma. E' vero che risultano molto rigide i primi tempi, ma già col poco utilizzo vedo cambiamenti. Infine, fatto non meno importante della comodità, sembrano molto ""abbinabili"", perché danno una bella forma a jeans un pò più larghi (slim, ad esempio) e stanno molto bene anche con gli skinny. Metto cinque stelle piene, che tengono conto sia della velocità e la precisione di Amazon che stupisce sempre di più (selezionata la consegna in 2-3 giorni, mi è arrivato l'oggetto il giorno dopo l'acquisto); sia per il fattore prezzo (viste in negozio a non meno di 130€, pagate meno di 90€).

    Ich trage diese Schuhe jahrelang und habe dieses Modell auch schon. Ich musste es mir beim Schuster bearbeiten lassen damit das Leder hinten keine Blasen beim Gehen macht. Das hatte bei den alten Schuhen gut geklappt. Bei den neuen war der Schuster leider zu faul und das Leder ist leider immer noch zu hart. Man muss es entweder weichlaufen oder weichklopfen.... Und dieses Angebot war mit ca. 100€ verhältnismässig günstig.

    Very nice shoe, comfy too! The only thing I would suggest is getting a half size down if possible. I got the UK 10, and have other docs in this size too but not this style, and these are a bit too big for me, a bit hard to walk in. I'm getting fillers so they will fit better, but definitely get a half size down from your original fit.

    Compré estos zapatos con la firme creencia que mejorarían mi día a día y no me equivocaba. La gente me respeta más ahora que los llevo, no sé si se atienen a un criterio estético o es porque les cortocircuita que afloje 100 rupias por unos zapatos, pero ¡Ay mi madre el bicho! Si duran 10 años bien amortizados estarán. Cómodos desde el instante uno, algo grandes todo hay que decirlo, calzo un 41 y me compré un 41 y voy algo holgado pero, ¿qué más da? Además me confieren un +1 a altura y solo por eso ya soy más alto que Messi. ¿Se puede pedir más? Pues no acaba aquí, hice la furla de probármelos en tienda física y comprarlos en Amazon, no es que sea cuestión de hundir al negocio local pero 50 maravedíes de diferencia me parece un margen fuera de mercado, me sale más barato construirme una Carabela e ir a buscarlos yo al Reino Unido, o a Taiwan o a donde sea que los produzcan. El color es ligeramente mate, y repelen el agua que da gusto. No los recomendaría para bañarse en la piscina pero no porque no sean impermeables sino porque tu hundirías hasta el fondo de lo que pesan. En verano y con temperaturas más altas dan una calor que te vuela la peluca, incluso después de llevarlos un rato puedes meter una pizza y la tienes hecha en un par de minutos. ¡Son una gozada!

    soddisfatto della spedizione, rapida e puntuale. le scarpe sono bellissime, purtroppo fidandomi dei consigli di amazon ho preso un 41 e mal me n'è incolto. nonostante infatti io porti di solito un 40/41 le scarpe sono risultate strettissime e pur provandole con cerotti e calze spesse mi hanno scavato i talloni. ho effettuato il reso e prenderò una taglia 42 quando mi arriverà il rimborso.

    So I just took delivery of my new Dr Martens 1461z's. These are the ones with the yellow trademark stitching around the sole. Rather than tell you how good they are, I'll tell you how good the pair that I'm replacing have been. I'm hard on shoes. A decent pair from a normal shoe shop will be lucky to last me four months before they either crack across the sole or the leather splits, or becomes so marked that even a polish won't hide how badly I've treated them. My current pair of DM's has lasted me 3 years of wearing to work, 5 days a week in all weathers, rain, hail, blistering sunshine and deep snow. I've never once troubled myself about slipping over, soaking my socks, or finishing the day with stinky feet. They just take the abuse and keep going. Somewhere in the middle of all that, I had a job interview, so they got a DM polish and buff up and looked like new. (ps, I got the job). If you want a decent pair of shoes that will last you, look good and serve your feet well, these are the beauties to have. Sure, they're not the cheapest but false economy of cheap shoes just doesn't work for me, and probably not you either. They get two thumbs up from me every time.

    After reading a few reviews I was a bit apprehensive knowing that they are now made abroad, but decided to purchase them anyway.Ok they are'nt as well made as before and probably won't last years like the original Dr Martins, but too be honest they are still comfortable, although probably a bit stiff at first and needed a few days wearing in.I would advise that the sizes are large and I should of ordered the size down and this was pointed out in other reviews.On the whole still a great shoe and I would buy another pair, and for £30 at the amazon market place itsa bargain

    Mens Skechers Cessnock Food Services Shoes are easy to put on and remove as there are no laces to deal with. The laces are purely decoratave. They are comfortable, have good traction, are easy to clean and they look good. I wear them as casual foot ware and I don't worry about them getting wet or dirty.

    I wear Skechers all the time.  I bought these pair for work and they are a great pair.  I work in a warehouse on cement floors.  I'm on my feet nine hours a day and have no issues.  I gave it a 4 because I have plantar fasciitis and need inserts.  The inserts that were in them did not support my feet very well.

    I purchased this shoe as well as a pair of the Skecher Afterburn M tennis shoes.  I wanted a dedicated work shoe, because I was going though my shoes pretty quickly from wearing the same pair all the time.  So, being that I had already had two previous pairs of the “Afterburn” shoe, and burned through each of them in just over a year respectively, I decided to get another pair of them and also get a pair of the Cessnock Food Service Shoe strictly for work.  Both pairs of shoes arrived yesterday, and today I wore the Food Service shoe (FSS) to work for the first time.I slipped them on and found them to be a perfect fit.  They are very light weight and comfortable.  Usually, I find new shoes need a few days of wear to break-in until they really conform to the shape of your foot and then begin to fit well, but that wasn’t the case with these FSS shoes; they fit perfectly the moment I put them on.I wore them all day at work and discovered something that really surprised me.  We had a snowstorm today and got about 2” by the time I got to work, and had a good 7” by the end of my shift.  I park outside so of course I have to brush the snow off the car.  After doing so I knocked the snow off my shoes before getting into the car.  I was surprised to see that the snow didn’t stick to the material on top of the shoes, it was as if there was a water repellant in/on the material.  I was sort of wondering why my feet weren’t getting cold while I was cleaning off my car and I guess that explains it.  Another surprise was the fact that these shoes make no sound when walking on a tile floor while having wet soles.  The “Afterburn” tennis shoes squeak like a rusty hinge when the bottom of the shoe is wet and you walk across tile or other such surfaces, but the FSS’s, are quiet as a mouse, not a sound comes from them, you could almost call them Ninja shoes.As for the style, well that’s a personal preference and these shoes suit me just fine.  I think they look sharp, and nobody even noticed I had a new pair of shoes on today.Durability is the unanswered question and being that I’ve only worn them one day, that question will remain unanswered for a while.  If I can get a solid two years out of them, just wearing them to work, I will definitely buy them again and certainly would recommend them to a friend.I hope this review helps with your decision.  Peace.

    Bought a pair that was similar but a different style a year ago and had to replace them as I literally walked holes through the rubber soles.  They were the best shoes I've ever had.  Bought these put of necessity and while the shoes hurt to wear the first couple pf days, these took far less time than the last pair I owned and are even better.I have extremely wide feet at the toes due to growing up ""toe-walking"" with a very narrow heel, so on the rare occasion I can find shoes that fit my width even a little, my heel comes put when I walk.  My feet would also rip them apart within months.  The slightly  stretchy material of these shoes accommodate my wide toes but keep my heels in place.  My last pair didn't suffer any damage due to my feet and only due to normal wear and tear.I even bought a size 11 (no wide) and it fits my weird feet fantastically.  If you have a similar issue with your feet, give them a try!

    These arch fit shoes are very comfortable for long hours of standing on concrete as a mechanic. They are extremely breathable so my feet don’t sweat in summer heat. The soles are extremely non-slip on wet surfaces. This is my first pair of shoes with the stretch on laces, but definitely won’t be my last! The only downsides are the breathable fabric exterior attracts dirt like a magnet and they always look dirty when wearing in mechanics shop. The other issue is the soles tend to pickup tiny dirt & stones that end up falling out in the front office. But, I would still highly recommend & the two issues would not likely be a problem in most jobs.

    Shoe seems good, but it was a bit loose fir my son who usually wears a 9..I shop a lot from Amazon, and since many of the items are just pictures and with a possibility of it not meeting your expectations or fit I make sure there is free returns on purchases.I’m now having to may a shipping fee for the return which I’m not happy about in any way.  Also today while shopping for a smaller size found the same shoe $20 cheaper at other places with free shipping and with same day shipping.I think I had a blind faith shopping with this seller.Experience like this will definitely bring down your bias with the brand itself..

    EDIT: After daily wearing them even just as normal running shoes and not just for work for the past 14 months (1 Year 2 Month) I purchased these on may 13th of 2021, it’s currently July 15th 2022! they are still holding up fantastically!!  They have been comfortable and perfect every single day! I’ve tried other shoes and just can’t get comfortable the way I do with these! I’ve come to this page again today to finally purchase more and not because they are totally gone but only because the glue on one the left shoe is starting to come off from the sole! But even with that happening I could still get atleast 5 more months out of these bad boys but I want to grab new ones out of personal preference!! To anyone looking for a fantastic non slip shoes these sketchers are definitely a great buy! I’ve attached photos of the shoes and how they look after 14 months of heavy wear!EDIT: After daily wearing them for the past 4 months they have held up great! The cusion in the sole is wearing down but all in all they are holding up well! I’ve put them thru hell and back and still love them! 10 / 10 will buy another pair when these goSuper comfy! Way better than my Walmart bought non-slips, with my old shoes my feet would be so sore afterwork I would have to sit in my car for 10-15 minutes after putting my runners on and before driving 30 min home, these are great! Could use more cushion in the soles but nothing Dr. Sholl’s can’t fix, can’t speak for longevity as have only had them 1 day, will update review if I find and faults and will update biased on longevity

I have larger feet, 12, wide.. so the clog type/rubber ones that are easy to spray and wipe clean are pretty tight on my feet, so I tried these.I just soaked and cleaned these ones before the photos, , they still look like new, they come scotchgarded (sp?) so nothing has stained them yet. They do get the odd crumb or speck of food in the knit fabric, but nothing has gotten stuck or embedded, or needed to really be scrubbed out. That is key, because I don’t wanna fray or cut or ruin the weave. I just use an old soft bristle toothbrush to flick anything out that fells into the in it weave.So I’m gonna get some more spray scotchgard from the store and continue cleaning them every 3-4 months or so, and see how long they last.But they look great, and are comfy for sure. I swap the insoles every few months also; it keeps my feet and knees from getting too sore.I enjoy these a lot. They also pass as normal shoes or sneakers.. so if you’re out in public you don’t have to feel too weird because most kitchen shoes look odd or bizzare lol.

    I should have ordered wide, but I own many pairs of skechers and they always have been very comfortable and loose fitting. They dropped the ball on these big time.

    These shoes aren't just good for those who work in food service but also for those who work in retail who may also be standing/walking for seven-to-eight hours. The shoes do feel a little big upon first wearing them. But, wear them for a full day or two and guarantee you'll barely even notice while working.

My teenage son needed slip resistant shoes for his new fast food restaurant job. I knew that style was just as important to him as comfort. After doing several searches I purchased the Sketches slip resistant shoes. They were worth every penny. They are well made, he really likes the look of them, they are comfortable, and easy to slip in and off and provide plenty of support and slip resistance. He needed them within 48 hours and they arrived the day after I ordered them.

    The shoes are comfortable but run big! You can snug up the elastic lace but it eventually loosens.  The lace is sewn in which makes it very challenging to replace if you choose to.  Otherwise a nice shoe.  Good cushioning and sole is very slip resistant

    I bartend at the theme parks in Orlando and average 10 miles plus a day, 6 days a week. I have burned through three different pairs of shoes in the past three months, until I found these! The conditions I am in are high volume wet conditions, and my feet stay perfectly dry in these shoes. The soles have the perfect height to keep the shoe dry, without being bulky preventing one from tripping over their own feet.I have a wide flat foot, and these shoes have PLENTY of room in them. I wear a 12W and order the same in these. When I first put them on, they feel really loose which caused concern, but after wearing them a few days, I actually like the feel of the “looseness” as there are ZERO pressure points on my feet with these shoes, and they are snug enough that blisters do not form. The toe box feels longer than a 12, but like I just stated, my feet do not slide in the shoes and no blisters form. I AM IN LOVE WITH THESE WORK SHOESThe shoes actually look great as well. I find myself throwing them on when heading out for casual fun too. I NEVER leave reviews, but decided to in hopes others may see this and helps them buy these shoes for the same relief. Stay comfortable my friends

    I work in food service and stand all day and run around like a maniac and these shoes are going straight into the dumpster out back. totally flat inside. no arch support, no bounce, no soft cushioned heel. Memory foam is maybe 1/8th of an inch thick so by the time you step on it its completely compressed with no benefit whatsoever, it'd be better without. I'm a size 8 and I ordered an 8, but it fits like an 8.5 so too loose. waste of my money.

    These are the second pair I've purchased. Wear them daily. However, I'm not a fan of the loose, stretchy laces. I completely remove the laces and replace them with regular laces (i can tie) so I can get a nice, snug fit. If you remove them, keep in mind, one loop is sewn in and you have to cut it out with a razor or exacto knife. Typically just one loop.

    I would RECOMMEND DO NOT BUY THESE shoes!!They are light and comfy - I will give them that.They are slippery af though. I work in a kitchen. I have almost slipped and fallen over 4 times because If you step on a piece of food the shoes will make your foot slide (kitchen floors are never perfectly clean). I have never had that problem with any other shoe. I wish I could get my money back and buy a better shoe. Also I would give zero for value for money if I could

Clear Skechers stop sewing the laces of your shoes into the loops. I need to install a set of laces which allows me to adjust the tension and you've made that nearly impossible for no reason.

    The only thing why I don't give a 5 star is because of your size guide chart shown in the mobile app, it is not acurate. It's supposed that the US size if it is 10, then EU should 44 and UK 9, however, these according to your size guide US 10.5 was 44 on EU and 9 UK, but yes it is 44 on EU, however 10.5 is 9.5 UK, so instead of being 28 cm they are 28.5 cm and my foot length is 28 cm, they are kinda big other than that nice shoes

    I’ve always bought my Skechers shoes from in-store and found size 7 (Australian and US) the perfect fit. First time attempt to order this item online has proved disappointing. While length of size 7 is adequate, the width is too narrow that only a third of my foot is able to get through inside the shoes. To avoid return fuss, we’re gifting the shoes to a sister whose feet are much slimmer and smaller.  The whole experience has unfortunately increased my personal aversion against online purchase specific to shoes.

The sole is thin but very good quality, and with a nice grip. The upper is very good quality, and very breathable. I wear them outside and to the gym too. The fit is good. I'm a 45 in these and a 45 in Nikes too. In other shoes I'm usually a 44. I tried the 44 in these and it was too small. My feet are around 28.5cm long.

    Son mis primeras zapatillas barefood y la verdad que estoy muy contento con ellas, son cómodas, se ajustan súper bien al pie y es como si fuera en calcetines. Las utilizo para diario y para entrenar en el gimnasio. Por ahora no se han roto y son transpirables así que el pie no suda. Las recomiendo para los iniciados al barefood.

    I went through about 10 pairs of Vapor glove 4’s. These are my second pair of Vapor glove 6’s.I have had many brands of barefoot style shoes over the years, including vivobarefoot, freet, xero, sole runner, vibrams etc and Vapor gloves have been my favourite. The downside is the durability, I was burning through the Vapor 4’s in under three months. The 6’s are no more durable than the 4’s and that is an issue considering the price but I have found durability with other brands to be even worse. The most recent purchases a made were xero prio’s, freet flex and vibe. I couldn’t possibly recommend the prio’s, I can’t understand why they are so highly regarded, the sole is extremely stiff in comparison to the Vapor’s, there may be room for the toes to wiggle but the sole doesn’t move along with them so the sole can effectively slap of the ground and the toes/feet follow, they don’t work in unison, they feel very clunky and the sole started to split from the upper after minimal use.The Vapor’s wrap around my feet and feel snug but don’t restrict the movement of my foot, more of a sock like fit so my feet don’t bounce around inside them causing friction and lack of direct feel of the ground like it get with other ‘barefoot’ shoes.Of course everyone is different, but for me these are the best.

    Hubby wanted a pair of minimalist shoes for his birthday so I went hunting. I came across these and we're pleasantly surprised by the cost and high ratings I ordered them for him and when he tried them on he was in love. He did a jog around our house a couple of times and was smiling from ear to ear. They have become his new work shoes, for an RMT they work great to work in without any blistering right away.  They help with foot distribution and back .He has purchased another pair since I ordered these.

    I have and use/love Trail Glove 5's, and 7's, and Xero Mesa Trail, and now also these.  These are by far the thinnest sole and are so comfy.  I run on Rocky trails alot and these will get used for that about 1/3 the time because little bruises.  It's worth it, but I like to switch between all those options I mentioned as they're all amazing.  These are the cheapest available thing when they're $99CAD, so I can't recommend them enough.All that said, I've run in them on plenty rough terrain a few times and they seem fine durability wise, but can't yet speak to the longevity.  $99 gives the a little wiggle room there, not a ton though because they don't have $99 worth of material in them, not even close.Fit exactly like Trail Glove 7, exactly like Trail Glove 5.

    tengo varios pares de Zapatillas barefoot de varias marcas. Estas son seguramente las más cómodas. La relación calidad precio es insuperable. Comparadas con el model vapor glove 3 lether, el model 6 se las nota más cómodas y mejor acabadas, sobretodo en la zona que roza con el talón.La suela Vibram te permite sentir la sensación como si fueras descalzo. Ten en cuenta que en general las Merrell tallan pequeño con lo que debes pedir como mínimo un número más del habitual. Usa las tablas recomendadas por el fabricante midiendo tu pie.

    Die Schuhe sitzen perfekt (habe weder kleiner noch größer bestellt) und sie sind so leicht, dass man sie kaum merkt. Das Klima innerhalb der Schuhe ist auch angenehm, denn man schwitzt kaum. Die Sohlen sind sehr biegsam und rutschfest mit vergleichsweise tiefem Profil. Trotz der Leichtigkeit und Luftigkeit wirkt das Material relativ stabil und lässt sich leicht reinigen.Einzig die Schnürsenkel gehen immer mal wieder gerne auf. Diese sollte man gegebenenfalls durch elastischen Senkeln auswechseln, die man nicht binden muss.

    Zapatillas minimalistas muy parecidas a las versión anterior. De todas las zapatillas minimalistas que tengo , la mayoría son Merrel Vapor Glove (o Luna), ya que relación calidad-precio son las mejores para mi.Como digo, son semejantes a la versión anterior. Parecen tener la misma horma y la misma forma de suela. Sin embargo, la trama de la suela sí que cambia y creo que va a ser un acierto. Lo digo porque la versión anterior tenía una especie de ""taquitos"" que se gastaban. Las últimas veces que ha tenido que cambiar las Vapor ha sido por el desgaste de la suela, que acababa haciendo un agujero. Lejos quedan los problemas de rasgado de la tela en la parte del ""upper"" de las primeras versiones, que obligaban al cambio de zapatillas en pocos meses e incluso semanas.Volviendo a la suela, la de esta versión tiene una trama más homogénea que probablemente retrasará el desgaste.Otra cosa a tener en cuenta es que al ser un calzado muy bajo es fácil que entre agua al pasar por suelos encharcados. Versiones anteriores intentaban mejorar este aspecto añadiendo una suerte de ""parches"" plásticos en los laterales. Sin embargo, estéticamente no los encontraba muy acertados. En esta versión, aunque la solución es la misma, han mejorado mucho y quedan más equilibrados con el diseño de la zapatilla.La ""tela"" de la zapatilla sí que ha cambiado mucho y, aunque es más bonita, no parece que vaya a ser tan resistente como la de las versiones anteriores. Parece que esta tela vaya a rasgarse con facilidad si se engancha con algo, cosa que no pasaba con las Glove 4, que tenían una ""tela"" realmente fuerte.Yo he comprado estas zapatillas en color negro y lo cierto es que me gustan mucho. Quizá sea por el color, o por el cambio de ""tela"", pero me dan la sensación de ser más agresivas y deportivas que las Glove 4 (más parecidas a las Saguaro). Otro cambio es que está versión tiene el cordón redondo en lugar de plano. Me gusta más este cordón y espero que la forma redonda no provoque que se desaten. Lo único que no me ha gustado, y es precisamente de los cordones, es que son demasiado largos y, siendo más gruesos que los anteriores, se ven demasiado incluso atados.En general, estoy muy satisfecho con la compra. Las zapatillas son tan o más cómodas que las anteriores y se adaptan muy bien al pie. El número és el que uso habitualmente en las Merrel (44'5), aunque me quedan un poquito más grandes que la versión anterior.Para mi, que siempre uso zapatillas minimalistas, y a la espera de la resistencia de la tela, es una compra muy recomendable.

Tengo unas Groundies Active de 120 euro (costan como la Merrel y la Saugaro juntas) y no valen en calidad, servicio al cliente de la marca, y comodidad, ni la mitad.

Auch wenn man sich an die veränderte Belastung  erst mal gewöhnen muss, haben Sie hervoragend gepasst, waren bequem und boten ein tolles Laufgefühl.Aber nach knapp 2,5 Monaten hatte ich das erste Loch in der Sohle.

    Update: bereits nach 2 Monaten moderater Nutzung ist das Profil praktisch komplett abgelaufen an einer Stelle. Dass es sich schneller abläuft als bei normalen Schuhen ist klar, aber der Gummi taugt garnichts. Nichts mit ""Vibram ist ja so toll""Meine Wander Stiefel haben auch Vibram und die werden wesentlich mehr und öfter beansprucht und sehen nach 4 Jahren immer noch aus wie neu. Für das Geld finde ich das etwas unverschämt.Auch die älteren Modelle von Merell sind WESENTLICH Verschleiß-resistenter.Die Schuhe hatten direkt ab Auslieferung einen Herstellungsfehler. Einer der Gummis in der Fußkante, der zum Schutz vor Abnutzung dienen soll, ist nicht richtig verklebt.Die Schuhe fallen etwas kleiner aus. Ich habe normal zwischen 42.5 und 43 und die Größe 43 war mir zu klein, da bin ich immer mit dem Fußzeh vorn angestoßen. 43.5 passt ganz passabel.Mit dem Gummi hat man unfassbar guten Grip, allerdings sorgt die Musterung dafür, dass man sämtlichen Dreck vom Waldboden etc förmlich aufsaugt und sich alles richtig schön rein hängt und nur mit ordentlich Stampfen wieder ab geht..Die Zehenbox ist für meinen Geschmack etwas zu eng für Barfuß Schuhe. Ich habe keine sonderlich unnormalen Füße, aber mein kleiner Zeh wird minimal eingedrückt. Das war bei den Vapor Glove 3 nicht der Fall.Alles in Allem ist der Schuh aber bequem und das, was ich erhofft / erwartet hatte. Ob der bei dem dünnen Gummi länger als ein Jahr hält, ist fraglich, wir werden sehen.Auf Grund der schlechten Verarbeitung und des meiner Meinung nach viel zu überteuerten Preises ziehe ich aber zwei Sterne ab. Gibt leider kaum Alternativen auf den Markt. Und die, die es gibt, sind meistens auch nicht gerade günstiger.

    I've been trying to find a cheaper option compared to Vivobarefoot and Wildlings shoes that also last a little bit longer and I think these are it. So far they have been great and have amazing traction. I put a small insert so my foot would fit a little bit better as it was a little too big. These are lighter than Wilding shoes which to me is impressive and I am very happy with.

Muy recomendables

    Nice looking pair of shoes, but not the most comfortable.  I found the soles a bit too firm and not flexible enough.  So if you're someone who walks a lot you may struggle with these.  Wearing them in general they're ok, but I definitely wouldn't run in them.

    Las zapatillas adidas Runfalcon 3.0 son decentes en general. Tienen un diseño clásico y una combinación de colores básica que podría funcionar bien con diferentes conjuntos. La calidad de construcción parece estar bien, y la marca adidas suele garantizar un cierto nivel de durabilidad.Sin embargo, en términos de comodidad y rendimiento, no son nada excepcionales. La amortiguación y el soporte son promedio, lo que podría no ser suficiente para actividades intensas como correr largas distancias o entrenamientos intensos en el gimnasio. Además, algunas personas podrían encontrar que la talla es un poco ajustada o ancha dependiendo de la forma de su pie.En resumen, si estás buscando unas zapatillas básicas para un uso casual o ligero, las adidas Runfalcon 3.0 podrían servirte. Pero si buscas un rendimiento óptimo o comodidad durante todo el día, es posible que quieras considerar otras opciones dentro del rango de precios similar

    普段はadidasのグランドコート等を履いていますが、長距離を歩くと流石に痛くなってきたため、こちらを購入。アホなので、観光地で20キロくらい移動するとさすがに疲労がたまり、痛いですがアーバンコートよりは疲れがたまりません。10キロくらいなら余裕で歩けます。軽い・衝撃吸収に優れているため、疲労を感じにくいのだと思います。ただ、通気性がいいため、運動をしていない際に履くと少々寒いかもしれません。

    For the price, these are lightweight, comfy, and the cloud foam sole is nicely bouncy.  They are made of thin fabric and don't have reinforcements around the toes like my old Asics.Even if it's not raining my socks get wet in these shoes very easily.  Even a hint of mist and my socks are wet.  I'm going to try to spray them with some waterproofing spray because it's pretty annoying having zero protection from the elements.

    Gorgeous, and a great price.Just be aware of one thing - converting Australian shoes sizes to American shoe sizes is a bit of a minefield! I'm a 7 Australian, which is often shown to convert to a 9 American. Except that's not always the case. A lot of the times American 9s are Australian 6's!Thankfully I knew I'd need to order a size up from the conversion chart - If you're not a slow addict like me you might accidentally order an incorrect size

    I ordered my usual size - an 8, and these are literally SO TIGHT across the toes. I'm probably going to return or resell these, there's just no point in trying to break them in.The seam on the far left and far right rub across my poor pinky toes. The toe area seems shorter than usual as well, no wiggle room at all.The soles don't flex well like they used to, and the tongues are SUPER OVERSTUFFED.I've worn DC shoes for literally a decade and I can't begin to express how disappointed I am by the brand in general. The shoes are bland and boring, the sizes are generally messed up, I ordered here because DC was 'out of stock' over a week after I ordered there.

    I struggled with getting the right size in women's in DCs. I've always had the men's versions of these for years. I have bought others in the past and they were always too tight in the toe box, or not wide enough. So blacks and greys were my normal colors, white too. Did my sizing research and got the correct size. I always have DCs. I use them for work and every day. They are the most comfortable shoes I've ever had. FINALLY pink ones. I'd say the width is a tad smaller and isnt as chunky but super happy with the purchase.

    I love this shoe! I want to address some things I have read in previous reviews. The shoe is a little more narrow towards the toes than what I myself was use to (Compared to older DC's I own). The lip on this particular shoe is fatter/thicker than older styles. The fit is true to size for me. I ordered an 8.5 and it fits perfect minus it being a little narrow. I read that these were not real DC's or they were knock offs. Prior to ordering this pair from amazon I ordered directly from DC a different pair. These are REAL DC's! The pair that came from DC directly is also made in Vietnam, have the same logos/markings inside and out. I am not sure where people are getting that they are not real. Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase! If you have any other questions regarding this shoe, send me a request for review!

    I have been searching for a pair of comfortable shoes for a while, when they came out with the new style. The ones made with material and soles that were glued on I was so depressed I live in Washington State and it rains here like crazy. It would make me mad when My feet would get soaked just walking out to check the mail. And the soles would fall apart because the glue would get wet. I was tired of spending $50 for shoes that made me miserable. I decided to check amazon and I was so satisified I could cry. I wish they would would bring back the shoes that were made for cold weather. And besides they are really cute. Thank you so much

Absolute rubbish. No strength in the arch, folds easily, no substantial foot base, thin cushioning foam, I’d be surprised if it cost them more then $5 to make. I’d had slippers with more strength then these. Shouldn’t be selling them as shoes, can’t see these lasting long, you’d get better shoes from Kmart. Embarrassing for Puma - just ruins brand perception. Returning. Don’t buy - they’re not quality shoes and are clearly made to profit without thought for durability, comfort… anything.

    I selected the size from other shoes I have and hoped they would fit. They did not. It appears that Puma sizes are somewhat smaller than other brands. I now have to return them, at my expense ( $40.00), and get a refund or a new pair. If they don’t fit I’ll have another return cost. I bought these trainers from Amazon.com.au but had to return them to USA. Not happy.

    Love the style, and they were exactly to what I was expecting. They fit a little tight, but that's only because I have a wide foot. Since they didn't have a wide option on this one, I got the next size up. Even after doing that it still fit a little tight, but I believe Pumas are usually like that. Still love them though.

    While I like the look, fit, and comfort of the shoe the laces started busting through the holes in the leather after less than a year.  My previous shoes were Nike Reax and literally lasted me years until the soles were worn to the point I thought I should probably replace them.  I'm losing the use of these because I can't tie them anymore even while the rest of the shoe is still in good shape.

    These are good walking, running, standing shoes.  They seem fairly durable. The paneling on the front toe makes it harder for them to catch and tear. Really great if you wear them in everyday life instead of just a track or a trail.  They are a little more narrow than I thought they would be. They're also hard to keep clean, but I think they look pretty cool.

    These are my second pair.I was gutted when I found most suppliers were now not stocking these particular trainers any more, so was really fortunate to find these available in my size.I personally think these are more a casual/fashion trainer rather than for running, based on the construction and weight of the material used in the soles.The white, black, and silver colour scheme looks great in my opinion and because of this they are a bit different to the usual stuff on sale.Very comfortable bit a bit heavy feel if you want them for active sports use. Size wise I take a 10.5 in most brands and these were bang on, and on a par with most Adidas and Nike shoes I usually wear.My first pair have lasted a year and with careful use and regular cleaning they still look pretty good with little wear or signs of rips, tears etc, but I liked them so much I started the hunt for a new identical pair.If you like them good luck in finding any in popular sizes, many sellers were out of stock in December when I was looking.Overall-  Good fit, size as expected, comfortable fashion trainer. May even grab a third pair while I can still get them.....

    I recently purchased the Etnies Men's Jameson 2 Eco sneakers and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. These sneakers are not only stylish and versatile, but they are also eco-friendly, which is a big plus.The sneakers are made from recycled materials, including recycled rubber outsoles and recycled plastic in the laces and eyelets. This is a great step towards sustainability and it's wonderful to see a brand like Etnies making a conscious effort to reduce their environmental impact.In terms of comfort and performance, these sneakers are top-notch. The foam insole provides excellent cushioning and support, while the padded tongue and collar add an extra layer of comfort. The grippy rubber outsole also provides good traction and stability, making these sneakers a great choice for a range of activities.What I appreciate most about these sneakers is the sleek and simple design. The black and gum colourway is timeless and can be paired with a variety of outfits. The embroidered Etnies logo on the side adds a subtle touch of branding without being too flashy.Overall, I would highly recommend the Etnies Men's Jameson 2 Eco sneakers to anyone looking for a stylish and comfortable option for everyday wear. They are eco-friendly, durable, and provide excellent comfort and support.

    I like the shoe. Looks minimalist and doesn’t have a huge “tongue” that you see on some other skate shoes.The end of the shoe is a bit elongated, but I’ve had shoes with this fit in the past and getting used to it again.

    The toe box is much more narrow than I would expect from a skater shoe. Looked more like a bowling shoe. I bought them bc I did like the color of the upper and sole. Seem to be well constructed. I returned them.

    Feel a bit disappointed to be honest. Look great online, but are a little flat in real life. The laces don't tie up great. I was hoping for a smart casual type buy but not too sure if it's hitting either of those marks. £50.00 quid too.

    10 months in wearing them daily not for skating (never liked canvas for skating rip way to quick) but just to kick around in and after about 8-9 months they just start ripping apart but I also walk 5-10 miles a day and work in these but they are still very very comfortable but it’s finally time for a new pair so for the $50 I spent can’t complain $5 month for comfy shoes not to shabby and I used and abused them around the homestead, woods, river, work, city I’d say they where a good pair

    Tercer para de jameson eco que tengo. Aunque esta vez he estado a punto de devolverlas ya que una de las zapatillas se veia demasiado el pegamento entre la suela y la tela. También habia una zapatilla que me quedaba mucho mas apretada que la otra. Es lo que me ha hecho casi devolverlas.Al final me las he quedado porque son preciosas y después de 2 puestas ya no se notan los fallos.En cuanto a la talla para ti talla bien, mismo numero que uso normalmente. Son unas zapas mas bien tirando a estrechas al principio pero luego se amoldan perfectamente. Y para mi lo mas importante a parte que me encanta el modelo, es que por cada zapatilla plantan un arbol.

    Huch, was ereilt mich denn da eine Woche früher als angekündigt? Meine Heelys sind ja schon da! Und ich freue mich RIESIG!Ich hatte als Teen welche und bin damit echt viel geskated. Ich habe diese Schuhe so geliebt und war unglaublich traurig festzustellen, dass nach dem Umzug lediglich Rollen und Werkzeug noch vorhanden waren. Nach etwas Bedenkzeit habe ich mich endschieden die schicken Dinger hier nochmal zu kaufen und ich bereue NICHTS.Ich hab normalerweise Schuhgröße 40-41, die 42 passt allerdings perfekt, da sie bisschen kleiner ausfallen. Ein Stern Abzug gibts für 1 Schnürsenkelpaar wo 1 Nadel fehlte, was das durchziehen etwas schwierig gestaltete. Da ich ihnen aber eh grüne Schnürsenkel verleihen möchte, geht das mal ohne weitere Beanstandung durch ;)Hoffentlich gibts die Tage nicht noch paar mehr Überraschungen, aber auf den ersten Blick scheinen sie stabil verarbeitet zu sein. Ich freue mich wieder ein bisschen Nostalgie zurückbekommen zu haben :)

    Die Schuhe kamen pünktlich an und funktionieren soweit auch gut. Allerdings war die Sohle sehr sehr schlecht verarbeitet und teilweise gar nicht richtig befestigt. Die schwarzen Stellen an der Sohle waren kaum festgelegt und hingen lose am Schuh. Ich habe die Schuhe dann selber nochmal kleben und fertig. Machen müssen, alles andere hätte mir zu lange gedauert, der Versand hat schon lange genug gebraucht. Also sowas habe ich noch nie gesehen.. 2* aber dafür dass der Schuh ansonsten gut funktioniert und spass macht.

    These shoes are probably the most comfortable dress shoe I’ve ever worn. I work 9-10 hour shifts on my feet in a grocery store and have been looking for comfortable shoes for years. Unfortunately these are not designated as slip resistant, but I’ve found that even when wet on slick floors they don’t slip. The leather is soft which prevents the crinkled look where the foot bends and also keeps the top of the shoe from hitting and rubbing the toes when bending. They seem to be extremely high quality and I can imagine I will get my moneys worth out of them.

    These are great shoes and well worth the money!  They feel good, look great, and are extremely well made.  Several other reviews mention size, and they do indeed run large.  I am a solid 12, so I ordered the 12-12.5.  They were way too big so I exchanged for the 11-11.5 and the fit was perfect. I plan to buy another pair in a different color,  and  I highly recommend these shoes. Your feet will thank you!

    I spend most of my life in comfortable shoes (trainers or approach/walking shoes) and generally hate having to wear uncomfortable 'dress shoes' on those odd occasions when I have to wear a suit. These hybrid ECCOs have, however, changed this, as they are are smart enough to be worn at any formal occasion, whilst also offering up the comfort and support generally associated with sneakers/trainers/walking shoes.Also very impressed that they are Gortex lined and therefore sufficiently waterproof for the wet London streets.Happy to recommend!

    Dessa skor har en ny typ av sula som är mjukare och har mindre stabilitet. Det gör att höft och leder får arbeta på annat sätt.

    Immediately on removing the shipping wrap, it was clear there was a problem. The box was was torn and the product label scraped off. Examining the shoe, it was clear by the wear on the outsole and dirt on the base, these shoes had been worn. The uppers had a couple of scuffs. They are going back.I've owned multiple pairs of Ecco shoes and continue to go back to this brand. The issue here is not the shoe per se. It's the inconvenience and disappointment of dealing with a product that should not have been shipped as new.

    I bought these in August last year and after a month or so of normal wear, the soles started separating from both shoes all around. This is now letting water in. Not what I expected from a pair of Ecco shoes.WARNING!!! Since the shoes are NOT covered by ECCO Manufacturer's Warranty you cannot claim against any defect outside the 30-day window. In other words, DO NOT BUY ECCO SHOES from Amazon.

I was fortunate to get it at lower than its usual price on Amazon which was almost 40% lower than what I would have paid at home for the same pair.Coming to the shoe, I am a UK10 and this pair fit me comfortably.

    Everything is fine. But I know the main secret of ECCO shoes. They are not stored for long. They have a guarantee of up to 10 years. And then you have to wait until the sole begins to deteriorate. It probably took you less time from production to consumer? We have ECCO stores, but there were a lot of negative cases; they probably sat in the warehouse for a long time.

    Design of the product is extremely good. But the quality of the shoe sole is 4/5. It may can slip on cemented pitches. But it has good grip on soily pitches. Light weight and comfortable.
